<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</a></h2>

<p class="p2">In this little book I have given the history of those
inventions which are most useful to man in his
daily life. I have told the story of the Match,
the Stove, the Lamp, the Forge, the Steam-Engine, the
Plow, the Reaper, the Mill, the Loom, the House, the
Carriage, the Boat, the Clock, the Book, and the Message.
From the history of these inventions we learn
how man became the master of the world of nature
around him, how he brought fire and air and earth
and water under his control and compelled them to
do his will and his work. When we trace the growth
of these inventions we at the same time trace the
course of human progress. These stories, therefore,
are stories of human progress; they are chapters in
the history of civilization.</p>

<p>And they are chapters which have not hitherto
been brought together in one book. Monographs on
most of the subjects included in this book have appeared,
and excellent books about modern inventions
have been written, but as far as I know, this is the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
first time the evolution of these useful inventions
has been fully traced in a single volume.</p>

<p>While preparing the stories I have received many
courtesies from officers in the Library of Congress
and from those of the National Museum.</p>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span>hese stories of useful inventions are chapters
in the history of civilization and this little book
is a book of history. Now we are told by Herodotus,
one of the oldest and greatest of historians, that when
the writer of history records an event he should state
the <i>time</i> and the <i>place</i> of its happening. In some
kinds of history&mdash;in the history of the world's wars,
for example, or in the history of its politics&mdash;this
is strictly true. When we are reading of the battle
of Bunker Hill we should be told precisely when
and where the battle was fought, and in an account
of the Declaration of Independence the time and
place of the declaration should be given. But in the
history of inventions we cannot always be precise as
to dates and places. Of course it cannot be told
when the first plow or the first loom or the first clock
was made. Inventions like these had their origin
far back in the earliest ages when there was no such<span class="pagenum pfirst"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">[x]</a></span>
person as a historian. And when we come to the
history of inventions in more recent times the historian
is still sometimes unable to discover the precise
time and place of an invention.</p>

<p>It is in the nature of things that the origin of
an invention should be surrounded by uncertainty and
doubt. An invention, as we shall see presently, is
nearly always a response to a certain want. The
world wants something and it promises a rich reward
to one who will furnish the desired thing. The inventor,
recognizing the want, sets to work to make
the thing, but he conducts his experiments in secret,
for the reason that he does not want another to steal
his ideas and get ahead of him. We can see that this
is true in respect to the flying machine. The first experiments
with the flying machine were conducted in
secret in out of the way places and pains were taken
that the public should know as little as possible about
the new machine and about the results of the experiments.
The history of the flying machine will of
course have to be written, but because of the secrecy
and mystery which surrounded the beginnings of the
invention it will be extremely difficult for the future
historian to tell precisely when the first flying machine
was invented or to name the inventor. If it is
so difficult to get the facts as to the origin of an in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi">[xi]</a></span>vention
in our own time, how much more difficult it is
to clear away the mystery and doubt which surround
the beginnings of an invention in an age long past!</p>

<p>In a history of inventions, then, the historian cannot
be precise in respect to dates and places. Fortunately
this is not a cause for deep regret. It is
not a great loss to truth that we cannot know precisely
when the first book was printed, nor does it
make much difference whether that book was printed
in Holland or in Germany. In giving an account of
an invention we may be content to treat the matter
of time and place broadly, for the story is apt to
carry us through a stretch of years that defies computation,
a stretch that is immensely longer than the
life of any nation. For our purpose these millenniums,
these long stretches of time, may be thought
of as being divided into three great periods, namely:
the <i>primitive</i>, the <i>ancient</i>, and the <i>modern</i> period.
Even a division so broad as this is not satisfactory,
for in the progress of their inventions all countries
have not kept equal step with the march of time. In
some things ancient Greece was modern, while in most
things modern Alaska is primitive and modern China
is ancient. Nevertheless it will be convenient at
times in this book to speak of the <i>primitive</i>, the <i>ancient</i>
and the <i>modern</i> periods, and it will be useful to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii">[xii]</a></span>
regard the <i>primitive</i> period as beginning with the
coming of man on earth and extending to the year
5000 B.&nbsp;C.; the <i>ancient</i> period may be thought of as
beginning with the year 5000 B.&nbsp;C. and ending with
the year 476 A.&nbsp;D., leaving for the <i>modern</i> period
the years that have passed since 476 A.&nbsp;D.</p>

<p>In tracing the growth of an invention the periods
indicated above can serve as a time-guide only
for those parts of the world where the course of civilization
has taken its way, for invention and civilization
have traveled the same road. The region of
the world's most advanced civilization includes the
lands bordering on the Mediterranean Sea, Central
and Northern Europe, the British Isles, North America,
South America and Australia. It is within this
region that we shall follow the development of whatever
invention is under consideration. When speaking
of the first forms of an invention, however, it
will sometimes be necessary, when an illustration is
desired, to draw upon the experience of people who
are outside of the wall of civilization. The reason
for going outside is plain. The first and simplest
forms of the useful inventions have utterly perished in
civilized countries, but they still exist among savage
and barbarous peoples and it is among such peoples
that the first forms must be studied. Thus in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii">[xiii]</a></span>
story of the clock, we must go to a far-off peninsula
of Southern Asia <span class="locked">(p. 190)</span> for an illustration of the
beginning of our modern timepiece. Such a departure
from the beaten track of civilization does not
spoil the story, for as a rule, the rude forms of inventions
found among the lowest races of to-day are
precisely the same forms that were in use among the
Egyptians and Greeks when they were in their lowest
state.</p>

<p>When studying the history of an invention there
are two facts or principles which should ever be borne
in mind. The first principle is this: <i>Necessity is
the mother of invention.</i> This principle was touched
upon when it was said that an invention appears as a
response to a want. When the world wants an invention
it usually gets it and makes the most of it,
but it will have nothing to do with an invention it
does not want. The steam-engine was invented two
thousand years ago <span class="locked">(p. 55)</span> but the world then had
no work for steam to do, so the invention attracted
little attention and came to naught. About two hundred
years ago, however, man did want the services
of steam and inventors were not long in supplying the
engine that was needed. About a hundred years ago
the broad prairie lands of the United States began to
be tilled but it was soon found that the vast areas<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv">[xiv]</a></span>
could not be plowed and that the immense crops could
not be harvested by the old methods. So improvements
upon the plow and the reaper began to be made
and in time the steam gang-plow and the complete
harvester were invented. When the locomotive first
came into use a simple handbrake was used to stop the
slow-going trains, but as the size and the speed of
trains increased the handbrake became more and more
unsatisfactory. Sometimes a train would run as much
as a half mile beyond a station before it could be
stopped and then when "backed" it would again
pass beyond the station. The problem of stopping
the train promptly became fully as important as starting
it. The problem was solved by the invention of
the air-brake. And thus it has been with all the inventions
which surround us: necessity has been the
mother of them all.</p>

<p>The other principle is that a mechanical invention
is a <i>growth</i>, or, to state the truth in another
way, an invention nearly always is simply an improvement
upon a previous invention. The loom,
for example, was not invented by a particular person
at a particular time; it did not spring into existence
in a day with all its parts perfected; it <i>grew</i>, century
by century, piece by piece. In the stories which will
follow the steps in the growth of an invention are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv">[xv]</a></span>
shown in the illustrations. These pictures are not
for amusement but for study. As you read, examine
them carefully and they will teach you quite as much
about the growth of the invention as you can be taught
by words.</p>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">D</span>id you ever think how great and how many
are the blessings of fire? Try to think of a
world without fire. Suppose we should wake up
some bitter cold morning and find that all the fires
in the world were out, and that there was no way
of rekindling them; that the art of kindling a fire
had been lost. In such a plight we should all soon
be shivering with the cold, for our stoves and furnaces
could give us no warmth; we should all soon
be hungry, for we could not cook our food; we
should all soon be idle, for engines could not draw
trains, wheels of factories could not turn, and trade
and commerce would come to a standstill; at night
we would grope in darkness, for we could use neither
lamp nor gas nor electric light. It is easy to see
that without fire, whether for light or heat, the life
of man would be most wretched.</p>

<p>There never was a time when the world was without
fire, but there was a time when men did not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
know how to kindle fire; and after they learned how
to kindle one, it was a long, long time before they
learned how to kindle one easily. In these days we
can kindle a fire without any trouble, because we can
easily get a match; but we must remember that the
match is one of the most wonderful things in the
world, and that it took men thousands of years to
learn how to make one. Let us learn the history of
this familiar little object, the match.</p>

<p>Fire was first given to man by nature itself.
When a forest is set on fire by cinders from a neighboring
volcano, or when a tree is set ablaze by a
thunderbolt, we may say that nature strikes a match.
In the early history of the world, nature had to
kindle all the fires, for man by his own effort was
unable to produce a spark. The first method, then,
of getting fire for use was to light sticks of wood at
a flame kindled by nature&mdash;by a volcano, perhaps,
or by a stroke of lightning. These firebrands <span class="locked">(Fig.
1)</span> were carried to the home and used in kindling
the fires there. The fire secured in this way was
carefully guarded and was kept burning as long as
possible. But the flame, however faithfully watched,
would sometimes be extinguished. A sudden gust
of wind or a sudden shower would put it out. Then
a new firebrand would have to be secured, and this
often meant a long journey and a deal of trouble.</p>

  THE STICK-AND-GROOVE
  METHOD.
</div>

<p>In the course of time a man somewhere in the
world hit upon a plan of kindling a fire without having
any fire to begin with; that is to say, he hit upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
a plan of producing a fire by <i>artificial</i> means. He
knew that by rubbing his hands together very hard
and very fast he could make them very warm. By
trial he learned that by rubbing two pieces of dry
wood together he could make <i>them</i> very warm.
Then he asked himself the question: Can a fire be
kindled by rubbing two pieces
of wood together, if they are
rubbed hard enough? He
placed upon the ground a piece
of perfectly dry wood <span class="locked">(Fig. 2)</span>
and rubbed this with the end of
a stick until a groove was
made. In the groove a fine
dust of wood&mdash;a kind of sawdust&mdash;was
made by the rubbing.
He went on rubbing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
hard and fast, and, behold, the dust in the groove
began to glow! He placed some dry grass upon
the embers and blew upon them with his breath,
and the grass burst into a <span class="locked">flame.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">2</a></span> Here for the
first time a man kindled a fire for himself. He
had invented the match, the greatest invention, perhaps,
in the history of the world.</p>

<p>The stick-and-groove method&mdash;as we may call it&mdash;of
getting a flame was much better than guarding
fire and carrying it from place to place; yet it
was, nevertheless, a very clumsy method. The wood
used had to be perfectly dry, and the rubbing required
a vast amount of work and patience. Sometimes
it would take hours to
produce the spark. After a
while&mdash;and doubtless it was a
very long while&mdash;it was found
that it was better to keep the
end of the stick in one spot and
twirl it <span class="locked">(Fig. 3)</span> than it was to
plow to and fro with it. The
twirling motion made a hole in
which the heat produced by the
friction was confined in a small
space. At first the drilling was done by twirling the
stick between the palms of the hands, but this made
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>the hands too hot for comfort, and the fire-makers
learned to do the twirling with a cord or <span class="locked">thong<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">3</a></span>
wrapped around the stick <span class="locked">(Fig. 4)</span>. You see, the
upper end of the stick which
serves as a drill turns in a cavity
in a mouthpiece which the
operator holds between his
teeth. If you should undertake
to use a fire-drill of this
kind, it is likely that your jaws
would be painfully jarred.</p>

<p>By both the methods described
above, the fire was obtained
by rubbing or <i>friction</i>. The friction method
seems to have been used by all primitive peoples,
and it is still in use among savages in various parts
of the world.</p>

  FIG. 5.&mdash;STRIKING
  FIRE.
</div>

<p>The second step in fire-making
was taken when it was discovered
that a spark can be made by striking
together a stone and a piece of
iron ore. Strike a piece of flint
against a piece of iron ore known
as pyrites, or fire-stone, and you will
make sparks fly. <span class="locked">(Fig. 5.)</span> Let
these sparks fall into small pieces
of dried moss or powdered charcoal,
and the <i>tinder</i>, as the moss or the charcoal is
called, will catch fire. It will glow, but it will not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>blaze. Now hold a dry splinter in the glowing tinder,
and fan or blow with the breath and the splinter
will burst into a flame. If you will tip your splinter
with sulphur before you place it in the burning tinder,
you will get a flame at once. This was the
strike-a-light, or <i>percussion</i>, method of making a fire.
It followed the friction method, and was a great improvement
upon it because it took less work and a
shorter time to get a blaze. The regular outfit for
fire-making with the strike-a-light consisted of a tinder-box,
a piece of steel, a piece of flint, and some
splinters tipped with sulphur <span class="locked">(Fig. 6)</span>. The flint
and steel were struck together, and the sparks thus
made fell into the tinder and made it glow. A splinter
was applied as quickly as possible to the tinder,
and when a flame was produced the candle which
rested in the socket on the tinder-box was lighted.
As soon as the splinter was lighted the cover was re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>placed
on the tinder-box, so as to smother the glowing
tinder and save it for another time.</p>

  FIG. 6.&mdash;TINDER BOX, FLINT, STEEL, AND SULPHUR-TIPPED
  SPLINTERS.
</div>

<p>The strike-a-light method was discovered many
thousands of years ago, and it has been used by
nearly all the civilized nations of the <span class="locked">world.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></span> And
it has not been so very long since this method was
laid aside. There are many people now living who
remember when the flint and steel and tinder-box
were in use in almost every household.</p>

<p>About three hundred years ago a third method
of producing fire was discovered. If you should drop
a small quantity of sulphuric acid into a mixture of
chlorate of potash and sugar, you would produce a
bright flame. Here was a hint for a new way of
making a fire; and a thoughtful man in Vienna, in
the seventeenth century, profited by the hint. He
took one of the sulphur-tipped splinters which he
was accustomed to use with his tinder-box, and
dipped it into sulphuric acid, and then applied it to
a mixture of chlorate of potash and sugar. The
splinter caught fire and burned with a blaze. Here
was neither friction nor percussion. The chemical
substances were simply brought together, and they
caught fire of themselves; that is to say, they caught
fire by <i>chemical</i> action.</p>

<p>The discovery made by the Vienna man led to a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>new kind of match&mdash;the chemical match. A practical
outfit for fire-making now consisted of a bottle
of sulphuric acid (vitriol) and a bundle of splints
tipped with sulphur, chlorate of potash, and sugar.
Matches of this kind were very expensive, costing as
much as five dollars a hundred; besides, they were
very unsatisfactory. Often when the match was
dipped into the acid it would not catch fire, but would
smolder and sputter and throw the acid about and
spoil both the clothes and the temper. These dip-splint
matches were used in the eighteenth century by
those who liked them and could afford to buy them.
They did not, however, drive out the old strike-a-light
and tinder-box.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century&mdash;the century in which
so many wonderful things were done&mdash;the fourth
step in the development of the match was taken. In
1827, John Walker, a druggist in a small English
town, tipped a splint with sulphur, chlorate of potash,
and sulphid of antimony, and rubbed it on sandpaper,
and it burst into flame. The druggist had
discovered the first <i>friction-chemical</i> match, the kind
we use to-day. It is called friction-chemical because
it is made by mixing certain chemicals together and
rubbing them. Although Walker's match did not
require the bottle of acid, nevertheless it was not a
good one. It could be lighted only by hard rubbing,
and it sputtered and threw fire in all directions.
In a few years, however, phosphorus was
substituted on the tip for antimony, and the change<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
worked wonders. The match could now be lighted
with very little rubbing, and it was no longer necessary
to have sandpaper upon which to rub it. It
would ignite when rubbed on any dry surface, and
there was no longer any sputtering. This was the
<i>phosphorus</i> match, the match with which we are so
familiar.</p>

  <img src="images/i_011.jpg" width="159" height="187" alt="" /><br />
  FIG. 7.&mdash;A "BLOCK" OF
MATCHES.
</div>

<p>After the invention of the easily-lighted phosphorus
match there was no longer use for the dip-splint
or the strike-a-light.
The old methods of getting a
blaze were gradually laid
aside and forgotten. The
first phosphorus matches were
sold at twenty-five cents a
block&mdash;a block <span class="locked">(Fig. 7)</span>
containing a hundred and
forty-four matches. They
were used by few. Now a
hundred matches can be
bought for a cent. It is said
that in the United States we use about 150,000,000,000
matches a year. This, on an average, is about
five matches a day for each person.</p>

<p>There is one thing against the phosphorus match:
it ignites too easily. If one is left on the floor,
it may be ignited by stepping upon it, or by
something falling upon it. We may step on a phosphorus
match unawares, light it, leave it burning,
and thus set the house on fire. Mice often<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
have caused fires by gnawing the phosphorus matches
and igniting them. In one city thirty destructive
fires were caused in one year by mice lighting matches.</p>

  FIG. 8.&mdash;A BOX OF MODERN SAFETY
  MATCHES.
</div>

<p>To avoid accident by matches, the <i>safety match</i>
<span class="locked">(Fig. 8)</span> has recently
been invented.
The safety match
does not contain
phosphorus. The
phosphorus is mixed
with fine sand and
glued to the side of the box in which the matches are
sold. The safety match, therefore, cannot be lighted
unless it is rubbed on the phosphorus on the outside
of the box. It is so much better than the old kind of
phosphorus match that it is driving the latter out of
the market. Indeed, in some places it is forbidden
by law to sell any kind of match but the safety match.</p>

<p>The invention of the safety match is the last step
in the long history of fire-making. The first match
was lighted by rubbing, and the match of our own
time is lighted by rubbing; yet what a difference there
is between the two! With the plowing-stick or fire-drill
it took strength and time and skill to get a
blaze; with the safety match an awkward little child
can kindle a fire in a second.</p>

<p>And how long it has taken to make the match as
good as it is! The steam-engine, the telegraph,
the telephone, and the electric light were all in use
before the simple little safety match.</p>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">F</span>rom the story of the match you have learned
how man through long ages of experience
gradually mastered the art of making a fire easily
and quickly. In this chapter, and in several which
are to follow, we shall have the history of those inventions
which have enabled man to make the best
use of fire. Since the first and greatest use of fire
is to cook food and keep the body warm, our account
of the inventions connected with the use of fire may
best begin with the story of the stove.</p>

  FIG. 1.&mdash;THE PRIMITIVE STOVE.
</div>

<p>The most important uses of fire were taught by
fire itself. As the primitive man stood near the
flames of the burning tree and felt their pleasant
glow, he learned that fire may add to bodily comfort;
and when the flames swept through a forest
and overtook a deer and baked it, he learned that
fire might be used to improve the quality of his food.
The hint was not lost. He took a burning torch
to his cave or hut and kindled a fire on his floor
of earth. His dwelling filled with smoke, but he
could endure the discomfort for the sake of the
fire's warmth, and for the sake of the toothsomeness
of the cooked meats. After a time a hole was made
in the roof of the hut, and through this hole the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
smoke passed out. Here was the first stove. The
primitive stove was the entire house; the floor was
the fireplace and the hole in the roof was the
chimney <span class="locked">(Fig. 1).</span> The word "stove" originally
meant "a heated room." So that if we should say
that at first people lived in their stoves, we should
say that which is literally true.</p>

<div class="fl-cap" style="width: 220px;">
  <img src="images/i_015s.jpg" width="220" height="151" alt="" /><br />
  FIG. 2.&mdash;PRIMITIVE COOKING.
</div>

<p>Early inventions in cooking consisted in simple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
devices for applying flame directly to the thing which
was to be cooked. The first roasting was doubtless
done by fastening the flesh to a pole placed in a
horizontal position above the fire and supported as
is shown in <span class="locked">Figure 2.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">5</a></span> The horizontal bar called a
spit was originally of wood, but after man had learned
to work in metals an iron bar was used. When
one side of the flesh was roasted the spit was turned
and the other side was exposed to the flames. The
spit of the primitive age was the parent of the modern
grill and broiler.</p>

<p>Food was first boiled in a hole in the ground. A
hole was filled with water into which heated stones
were thrown. The stones, by giving off their heat,
caused the water to boil in a very short time. After
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>the art of making vessels of clay was learned, food
was boiled in earthen pots suspended above the fire.</p>

<p>The methods of warming the house and cooking
the food which have just been described were certainly
crude and inconvenient, but it was thousands
of years before better methods were invented. The
long periods of savagery and barbarism passed and
the period of civilization was ushered in, but civilization
did not at once bring better stoves. Neither
the ancient Egyptians nor the ancient Greeks knew
how to heat a house comfortably and conveniently.
All of them used the primitive stove&mdash;a fire on
the floor and a hole in the roof. In the house of
an ancient Greek there was usually one room which
could be heated when there was need, and this was
called the "black-room" (<i>atrium</i>)&mdash;black from
the soot and smoke which escaped from the fire on
the floor.</p>

<p>But we must not speak harshly of the ancients
because they were slow in improving their methods
of heating, for in truth the modern world has not
done as well in this direction as might have been expected.
In a book of travels written only sixty
years ago may be found the following passage: "In
Normandy, where the cold is severe and fire expensive,
the lace-makers, to keep themselves warm and
to save fuel, agree with some farmer who has cows
in winter quarters to be allowed to carry on their
work in the society of the cattle. The cows would
be tethered in a long row on one side of the apart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>ment,
and the lace-makers sit on the ground on the
other side with their feet buried in the straw."
Thus the lace-makers kept themselves warm by the
heat which came from the bodies of the cattle; the
cows, in other words, served as stoves. This barbarous
method of heating was practised in some parts of
France less than sixty years ago.</p>

  FIG. 3.&mdash;A ROMAN BRAZIER.
</div>

<p>The ancient peoples around the Mediterranean
may be excused for not making great progress in the
art of heating, for their climate was so mild that
they seldom had use for fire in the house. Nevertheless
there was in use among these people an invention
which has in the course of centuries developed
into the stove of to-day. This was the
<i>brazier</i>, or warming-pan <span class="locked">(Fig. 3)</span>. The brazier<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
was filled with burning charcoal and was carried
from room to room as it was needed. The unpleasant
gases which escaped from the charcoal were
made less offensive, but not less unhealthy, by burning
perfumes with the fuel. The brazier has never
been entirely laid aside. It is still used in Spain and
in other warm countries where the necessity for fire
is rarely felt.</p>

<div class="fl-cap" style="width: 174px;">

  FIG. 4.&mdash;A ROMAN HYPOCAUST.
</div>

<p>The brazier satisfied the wants of Greece, but the
colder climate of Rome required something better;
and in their efforts to invent something better, the
ancient Romans made real progress in the art of
warming their houses. They built a fire-room&mdash;called
a <i>hypocaust</i>&mdash;in the cellar, and, by means
of pipes made of baked clay, they connected the
hypocaust with different parts of the house <span class="locked">(Fig.
4).</span> Heat and smoke passed up together through
these pipes. The poor ancients, it seems, were forever
persecuted by smoke. However, after the
wood in the hypocaust was once well charred, the
smoke was not so troublesome. The celebrated
baths (club-rooms) of ancient Rome were heated
by means of hypocausts with excellent results. Indeed,
the hypocaust had many of the features and
many of the merits of our modern furnace. Its
weak feature was that it had no separate pipe to
carry away the smoke. But as there were no chimneys
yet in the world, it is no wonder there was no
such pipe.</p>

<p>The Romans made quite as much progress in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
art of cooking as they did in the art of heating.
Perhaps the world has never seen more skilful cooks
than those who served in the mansions of the rich
during the period of the Roman Empire (27 <span class="smallish smcap">B.C.</span>-476
<span class="smallish smcap">A.D.</span>). In this period the great men at Rome
abandoned their plain way of living and became
gourmands. One of them wished for the neck of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
a crane, that he might enjoy for a longer time his
food as it descended. This demand for tempting
viands developed a race of cooks who were artists in
their way. Upon one occasion a king called for a
certain kind of fish. The fish could not be had, but
the cook was equal to the emergency. "He cut a
large turnip to the perfect imitation of the fish desired,
and this he fried and seasoned so skilfully
that his majesty's taste was exquisitely deceived, and
he praised the root to his guests as an excellent fish."
Such excellent cooking could not be done on a primitive
stove, and along with the improvements in the
art of cooking, there was a corresponding improvement
at Rome in the art of stove-making.</p>

<p>When Rome fell (476 <span class="smallish smcap">A.D.</span>), many of the best
features of her civilization perished with her.
Among the things that were lost to the world were
the Roman methods of cooking and heating. When
the barbarians came in at the front door, the cooks
fled from the kitchen. The hardy northerners had
no taste for dainty cooking. Hypocausts ceased to
be used, and were no longer built. For several
hundred years, in all the countries of Europe, the
fireplace was located, as of old, on the floor in the
center of the room, while the smoke was allowed to
pass out through a hole in the roof.</p>

  <div class="hang">FIG. 5.&mdash;A CHIMNEY AND FIREPLACE IN AN OLD ENGLISH CASTLE.</div>
</div>

<p>The eleventh century brought a great improvement
in the art of heating, and the improvement
came from England. About the time of the Conquest
(1066) a great deal of fighting was done on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the roofs of English fortresses, and the smoke coming
up through the hole in the center of the roof
proved to be troublesome to the soldiers. So the fire
was moved from the center of the floor to a spot
near an outside wall, and an opening was made
in the wall just above the fire, so that the smoke
could pass out. Here was the origin of the <i>chimney</i>.
Projecting from the wall above the fire was
a hood, which served to direct the smoke to the
opening. At first the opening for the smoke extended
but a few feet from the fire, but it was soon
found that the further up
the wall the opening extended
the better was the
draft. So the chimney was
made to run diagonally up
the wall as far as possi<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>ble.
The next and last step in the development of
the chimney was to make a recess in the wall as
a fireplace, and to build a separate structure of
masonry&mdash;the chimney&mdash;for the smoke. By the
middle of the fourteenth century chimneys were
usually built in this way <span class="locked">(Fig. 5).</span> As the fireplace
and chimney cleared the house of soot and smoke,
they grew in favor rapidly. By the end of the fifteenth
century they were found in the homes of
nearly all civilized people.</p>

  FIG. 6.&mdash;A STOVE OF THE MIDDLE AGES.
</div>

<p>The open fireplace was always cheerful, and it
was comfortable when you were close to it; but it
did not heat all parts of the room equally. That
part next to the fireplace might be too warm for comfort,
while in another part of the room it might be
freezing. About the end of the fifteenth century
efforts were made to distribute heat throughout the
room more evenly. These efforts led to the invention
of the modern stove. We have learned
that the origin of the stove is to be sought in the
ancient brazier. In the middle ages the brazier in
France took on a new form. Here was a fire-box
<span class="locked">(Fig. 6)</span> with openings at the bottom for drafts of
air and arrangements at the top for cooking things.
This French warming-pan (<i>réchaud</i>) was the connecting-link
between the ancient brazier and the modern
stove. All it lacked of being a stove was a
pipe to carry off the smoke, and this was added by
a Frenchman named Savot, about two hundred years
ago. We owe the invention of the chimney to Eng<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>land,
but for the stove we are indebted to France.
The Frenchman built an iron fire-box, with openings
for drafts, and connected the box with the chimney
by means of an iron flue or pipe. Here was
a <i>stove</i> which could be placed in the middle of the
room, or in any part of the room where it was desirable,
and which would send out its heat evenly in
all directions.</p>

  FIG. 8.&mdash;AN OLD-FASHIONED FIREPLACE AND OVEN.
</div>

<p>The first stoves were, of course, clumsy and unsatisfactory;
but inventors kept working at them,
making them better both for cooking and for heat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>ing.
By the middle of the nineteenth century
the stove was practically what it is to-day <span class="locked">(Fig.
7).</span> Stoves proved to be so much better than fireplaces,
that the latter were gradually replaced in
large part by the former. Our affection, however,
for a blazing fire is strong, and it is not likely that
the old-fashioned fireplace <span class="locked">(Fig. 8)</span> will ever entirely
disappear.</p>

<p>The French stove just described is intended to
heat only one room. If a house with a dozen rooms
is to be heated, a dozen stoves are necessary. About
one hundred years ago there began to appear an
invention by which a house of many rooms could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
heated by means of one stove. This invention was
the <i>furnace</i>. Place in the cellar a large stove, and
run pipes from the stove to the different rooms of the
house, and you have a furnace <span class="locked">(Fig. 9).</span> Doubtless
we got our idea of the furnace from the Roman
hypocaust, although the Roman invention had no
special pipe for the smoke. The first furnaces sent
out only hot air, but in recent years steam or hot
water is sent out through the pipes to <i>radiators</i>,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
which are simply secondary stoves set up in convenient
places and at a distance from the source of
the heat, the furnace in the cellar. Furnaces were
invented for the purpose of heating large buildings,
but they are now used in ordinary dwellings.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
In its last and most highly developed form, the
stove appears not only without dust and smoke, but
also without even a fire in the cellar. The modern
<i>electric</i> stove, of course, is meant. Pass a slight
current of electricity through a piece of platinum
wire, and the platinum becomes hot. You have
made a diminutive electric stove. Increase the
strength of your current and pass it through something
which offers greater resistance than the platinum,
and you get more heat. The electric stove
is a new invention, and at present it is too expensive
for general use, although the number of houses in
which it is used is rapidly increasing, and in time
it may drive out all other kinds of stoves. It will
certainly drive all of them out if the cost of electricity
shall be sufficiently reduced; for it is the cleanest,
the healthiest, the most convenient, and the most
easily controlled of stoves.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_LAMP" id="THE_LAMP">THE LAMP</a></h2>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">N</span>ext to its usefulness for heating and cooking,
the greatest use of fire is to furnish light
to drive away darkness. Man is not content, like
birds and brutes, to go to sleep at the setting of the
sun. He takes a part of the night-time and uses it
for work or for travel or for social pleasures, or for
the improvement of his mind, and in this way adds
several years to life. He could not do this if he
were compelled to grope in darkness. When the
great source of daylight disappears he must make
light for himself, for the sources of night-light&mdash;the
moon and stars and aurora borealis and lightning&mdash;are
not sufficient to satisfy his wants. In this
chapter we shall follow man in his efforts to conquer
darkness, and we shall have the story of the
lamp.</p>

  FIG. 1.&mdash;A FIREFLY LAMP.
</div>

<p>We may begin the story with an odd but interesting
kind of lamp. The firefly or lightning-bug
which we see so often in the summer nights was in
the earliest time brought into service and made to
shed its light for man. Fireflies were imprisoned
in a rude box&mdash;in the shell of a cocoanut, perhaps,
or in a gourd&mdash;and the light of their bodies was
allowed to shoot out through the numerous holes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
made in the box. We must not despise the light
given out by these tiny creatures. "In the mountains
of Tijuca," says a
traveler, "I have read the
finest print by the light of
one of these natural lamps
(fireflies) placed under a
common glass tumbler
<span class="locked">(Fig. 1),</span> and with distinctness
I could tell the hour of
the night and discern the
very small figures which
marked the seconds of a little Swiss watch."</p>

  FIG. 2.&mdash;A BURNING STICK
  WAS THE FIRST LAMP.
</div>

<p>Although fireflies have been used here and there
by primitive folk, they could
hardly have been the first
lamp. Man's battle with
darkness really began with
the <i>torch</i>, which was lighted
at the fire in the cave or in the
wigwam and kept burning for
purposes of illumination. A
burning stick was the first
lamp <span class="locked">(Fig. 2).</span> The first
improvement in the torch
was made when slivers or
splinters of resinous or oily
wood were tied together and
burned. We may regard
this as a lamp which is all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
wick. This invention resulted in a fuller and
clearer light, and one that would burn longer than
the single stick. A further improvement came when
a long piece of wax or fatty substance was wrapped
about with leaves. This was something like a
candle, only the wick (the leaves) was outside, and
the oily substance which fed the wick was in the
center.</p>

<div class="fr-cap" style="width: 102px;">
  <img src="images/i_031a.jpg" width="102" height="305" alt="" /><br />
  FIG. 3.&mdash;THE
  CANDLE.
</div>

<p>In the course of time it was discovered that it was
better to smear the grease on the <i>outside</i> of the
stick, or on the outside of whatever was to be burned;
that is, that it was better to have the wick <i>inside</i>.
Torches were then made of rope coated with resin
or fat, or of sticks or splinters smeared with grease;
here the stick resembled the wick of the candle as
we know it to-day, and the coating of fat corresponded
to the tallow or paraffin. Rude candles
made of oiled rope or of sticks smeared with fat were
invented in primitive times, and they continued to
be used for thousands of years after men were civilized.
In the dark ages&mdash;and they were dark in
more senses than one&mdash;torch-makers began to wrap
the central stick first with flax or hemp and then
place around this a thick layer of fat. This torch
gave a very good light, but about the time of Alfred
the Great (900 <span class="smallish smcap">A.D.</span>) another step was taken: the
central stick was left out altogether, and the thick
layer of fat or wax was placed directly around the
wick of twisted cotton. All that was left of the
original torch&mdash;the stick of wood&mdash;was gone.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
The torch had developed into the <i>candle</i> <span class="locked">(Fig. 3).</span>
The candles of to-day are made of better material
than those of the olden time, and they
are much cheaper; yet in principle
they do not differ from the candles of a
thousand years ago.</p>

  FIG. 4.&mdash;A SHELL FILLED WITH
  OIL AND USED AS A LAMP.
</div>

<p>I have given the development of the
candle first because its forerunner, the
torch, was first used for lighting. But
it must not be forgotten that along
with the torch there was used, almost
from the beginning, another kind of
lamp. Almost as soon as men discovered
that the melted fat of animals
would burn easily&mdash;and that was certainly
very long ago&mdash;they invented
in a rude form the <i>lamp</i> from which
the lamp of to-day has been evolved.
The cavity of a shell <span class="locked">(Fig. 4)</span> or of a stone, or of the
skull of an animal, was filled with melted fat or oil,
and a wick of flax or other
fibrous material was laid
upon the edge of the vessel.
The oil or grease
passed up the wick by
capillary <span class="locked">action,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">6</a></span> and
when the end of the wick was lighted it continued to
burn as long as there were both oil and wick. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>was the earliest lamp. As man became more civilized,
instead of a hollow stone or a skull, an earthen
saucer or bowl was used. Around the edge of the
bowl a gutter or spout was made for holding the
wick. In the lamp of the ancient Greeks and
Romans the reservoir which held the oil was closed,
although in the center there was a hole through
which the oil might be poured. Sometimes one of
these lamps would have several spouts or nozzles.
The more wicks a lamp had, of course, the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
light it would give. There is in the museum at Cortona,
in Italy, an ancient lamp which has sixteen
nozzles. This interesting relic <span class="locked">(Fig. 5)</span> was used
in a pagan temple in Etruria more than twenty-five
hundred years ago.</p>

<p>Lamps such as have just been described were used
among the civilized peoples of the ancient world,
and continued to be used through the Middle Ages
far into modern times.
They were sometimes very
costly and beautiful <span class="locked">(Fig.
6),</span> but they never gave a
good light. They sent out
an unpleasant odor, and
they were so smoky that
they covered the walls and
furniture with soot. The
candle was in every way
better than the ancient
lamp, and after the invention
of wax tapers&mdash;candles
made of wax&mdash;in the
thirteenth century, lamps were no longer used
by those who could afford to buy tapers. For
ordinary purposes and ordinary people, however, the
lamp continued to do service, but it was not improved.
The eighteenth century had nearly passed,
and the lamp was still the unsatisfactory, disagreeable
thing it had always been.</p>

  FIG. 7.&mdash;AN ARGAND LAMP.
</div>

<p>Late in the eighteenth century the improvement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
came. In 1783 a man named Argand, a Swiss
physician residing in London, invented a lamp that
was far better than any that had ever been made before.
What did Argand do for the lamp? Examine
an ordinary lamp in which coal-oil is burned.
The <i>chimney</i> protects the
flame from sudden gusts
of wind and also creates a
draft of <span class="locked">air,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">7</a></span> just as the fire-chimney
creates a draft.
Argand's lamp <span class="locked">(Fig. 7)</span> was
the first to have a chimney.
Look below the chimney and
you will see open passages
through which air may pass
upward and find its way to
the wick. Notice further
that as this draft of air
passes upward it is so directed
that, when the lamp
is burning, an extra quantity
of air plays directly upon the
wick. Before Argand, the wick received no
supply of air. Now notice&mdash;and this is very important&mdash;that
the wick of our modern lamp is
flat or circular, but <i>thin</i>. The air in abundance
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>plays upon both sides of the thin wick, and burns it
without making smoke. Smoke is simply half-burned
particles (soot) of a burning substance.
The particles pass off half-burned because enough
air has not been supplied. Now Argand, by making
the wick thin and by causing plenty of air to
rush into the flame, caused all the wick to be burned
and thereby caused it to burn with a white flame.</p>

<p>After the invention of Argand, the art of lamp-making
improved by leaps and by bounds. More
progress was made in twenty years after 1783 than
had been made in twenty centuries before. New
burners were invented, new and better oils were
used, and better wicks made. But all the new kinds
of lamps were patterned after the Argand. The
lamp you use at home may not be a real Argand, but
it is doubtless made according to the principles of the
lamp invented by the Swiss physician in 1783.</p>

<p>Soon after Argand invented his lamp, William
Murdock, a Scottish inventor, showed the world a
new way of lighting a house. It had long been
known that fat or coal, when heated, gives off a
vapor or gas which burns with a bright light. Indeed,
it is <i>always</i> a gas that burns, and not a hard
substance. In the candle or in the lamp the flame
heats the oil which comes up to it through the wick
and thus causes the oil to give off a gas. It is this
gas that burns and gives the light. Now Murdock,
in 1797, put this principle to a good use. He heated
coal in a large vessel, and allowed the gas which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
was driven off to pass through mains and tubes to
different parts of his house. Wherever he wanted
a light he let the gas escape
at the end of the
tube <span class="locked">(Fig. 8)</span> in a small
jet and lighted it. Here
was a lamp without a wick.
Murdock soon extended
his gas-pipes to his factories,
and lighted them
with gas. As soon as it
was learned how to make gas cheaply, and conduct it
safely from house to house, whole cities were rescued
from darkness by the new illuminant. A considerable
part of London was lighted by gas in 1815. Baltimore
was the first city in the United
States to be lighted by gas. This was
in 1821.</p>

  FIG. 9.&mdash;AN EARLY
  ARC LAMP.
</div>

<p>The gas-light proved to be so much
better than even the best of lamps,
that in towns and cities almost everybody
who could afford to do so laid
aside the old wick-lamp and burned
gas. About 1876, however, a new
kind of light began to appear. This
was the <i>electric</i> light. The powerful
<i>arc light</i> <span class="locked">(Fig. 9),</span> made by the passage
of a current of electricity between
two carbon points, was the first to be invented.
This gave as much light as a hundred<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
gas-jets or several hundred lamps. Such a light
was excellent for lighting streets, but its painful
glare and its sputtering rendered it unfit for use
within doors. It was not long, however, before an
electric light was invented which could be used anywhere.
This was the famous Edison's <i>incandescent</i>
or glow lamp <span class="locked">(Fig. 10),</span> which we see on every hand.
Edison's invention is only a few years old, yet there
are already more than thirty million incandescent
lamps in use in the United States alone.</p>

<p>The torch, the candle, the lamp, the gas-light, the
electric light,&mdash;these are the steps of the development
of the lamp. And how marvelous a growth
it is! How great the triumph over darkness! In
the beginning a piece of wood burns with a dull
flame, and fills the dingy wigwam or cave with soot
and smoke; now, at the pressure of a button, the
house is filled with a light that rivals the light of
day, with not a particle of smoke or soot or harmful
gas. Are there to be further triumphs in the
art of lighting? Are we to have a light that shall
drive out the electric light? Only time can tell.</p>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">A</span>fter men had learned how to use fire for
cooking and heating and lighting they slowly
learned how to use it when working with metals.
In the earliest times metals were not used. For
long ages stone was the only material that man
could fashion and shape to his use. During this
period, sometimes called the "stone age," weapons
were made of stone; dishes and cooking utensils were
made of stone; and even the poor, rude tools of the

  FIG. 2.&mdash;IMPLEMENTS OF THE BRONZE AGE.
</div>

<p>In the course of time man learned how to make
his implements and weapons of metals as well as of
stone. It is generally thought that bronze was the
first metal to be used and that the "stone age" was
followed directly by the "bronze age," a period
when all utensils, weapons, and tools were made
of bronze <span class="locked">(Fig. 2).</span> It is easy to believe that bronze
was used before iron, for bronze is made of a mixture
of tin and copper and these two metals are
often found in their pure or natural state. Whenever
primitive man, therefore, found pieces of pure
copper and tin, he could take the two metals and by
melting them could easily mix them and make bronze
of them. This bronze he could fashion to his use.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>There is no doubt that he did this at a very early
age. In nearly all parts of the world there are
proofs that in primitive times, many articles were
made of bronze.</p>

<p>If primitive man were slow to learn the use of iron
it was not because this metal was scarce, for iron
is everywhere. "Wherever, as we go up and down,
we see a red-colored surface, or a reddish tint upon
the solid substances of the earth, we see iron&mdash;the
bank of red clay, the red brick, the red paint upon
the house wall, the complexion of rosy youth, or my
lady's ribbon. Even the rosy apple derives its tint
from iron which it <span class="locked">contains."<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">8</a></span> But although iron
is so abundant it is seldom found in its pure or
natural state. It is nearly always mixed with other
substances, the mixture being known as iron ore.
Primitive man could find copper and tin in their pure
state but the only pure iron he could find was the
little which fell from heaven in the form of meteors,
and even this was not perfectly pure for meteoric
iron is also mixed slightly with other metals.</p>

<p>The iron which lay about primitive man in such
abundance was buried and locked tightly in an <i>ore</i>.
To separate the iron from the other substances
of the ore was by no means an easy thing to do.
Iron can best be extracted from the ore by putting
the ore in a fire and melting out the iron. Place
some iron ore in a fire and if the fire is hot enough&mdash;and
it must be very hot indeed&mdash;the iron will
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>leave the ore and will gather into a lump at the
bottom of the fire. To separate the iron from its
ore in this way is to make iron. When and where
man first learned the secret of making iron is of
course unknown. A camp-fire in some part of the
world may have shown to man the first lump of iron,
or a forest fire sweeping along and melting ores in
its path may have given the first hint for the manufacture
of iron.</p>

<p>Iron making at first doubtless consisted in simply
melting the ore in an open heap of burning wood or
charcoal, for charcoal is an excellent fuel for smelt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>ing
(melting) ores. But this open-fire method was
wasteful and tedious and at a very early date the
smelting of the ore was done in a rude sort of a furnace.
A hole ten or twelve feet deep was dug in
the side of a hill. In the hole were placed charcoal
and iron ore, first a layer of charcoal, then a
layer of the ore. At the top of the mass there was
an opening and at the bottom there were several
openings. When the mass was set on fire the openings
produced a good strong draft, the charcoal was
consumed, and the ore was smelted. The product
was a lump of <i>wrought iron</i>, known as the <i>bloom</i>.</p>

  FIG. 5.&mdash;THE WOODEN BELLOWS.
</div>

<p>The hillside furnace worked well enough when
the wind was favorable, but when the wind was unfavorable
there was no draft and no iron could
be made. So ironmakers found a way by which
the air could be driven into the furnace by artificial
means. They invented the <i>bellows</i>, a blowing apparatus
<span class="locked">(Fig. 3)</span> which was usually made of goat
skins sewed together and which was operated either
by the hands or by the feet <span class="locked">(Fig. 4).</span> Sometimes the
bellows consisted of a hollow log in which a piston
was worked up and down <span class="locked">(Fig. 5).</span> After the invention
of the bellows,
ironmakers
could make their
iron whenever and
wherever they
pleased, for they
could force air into<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
their furnaces at any time and at any place. This
rude bellows forcing a draft of air into a half-closed
furnace filled with a burning mass of charcoal
and iron ore was the first form of the forge, one of
the greatest of all inventions.</p>

<p>With the invention of the forge the stone age
gradually passed away and the iron age was ushered
in. Tools and weapons could now be made of iron.
And great was the difference between iron tools and
stone tools. To cut down a tree with a flint hatchet
required the labor of a man for a month, while to
clear a forest with such an implement was an impossible
task. But the forge gave to man iron for
the sharp cutting tools, for the ax and knife and
chisel and saw. With these he became the master of
wood and he could now easily cut down trees and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
build houses and make furniture and wagons and
boats.</p>

<p>As time went on and man advanced in civilization,
iron was found to be the most useful of metals.
Iron can be shaped into many forms. It can be
drawn into wire of any desired length or fineness, it
may be bent in any direction, it may be sharpened,
or hardened, or softened, at pleasure. "Iron accommodates
itself to all our wants and desires and
even to our caprices. It is equally serviceable to the
arts, the sciences, to agriculture and war; the same
ore furnishes the sword, the plowshare, the scythe,
the pruning-hook, the needle, the spring of a watch
or of a carriage, the chisel, the chain, the anchor,
the compass and the bomb. It is a medicine of much
virtue and the only metal friendly to the human
<span class="locked">frame."<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></span></p>

<p>A metal that was so useful was needed in large
quantities, yet the primitive forge could turn out
only small quantities of iron. A day's labor at the
bellows would produce a lump weighing only fifteen
or twenty pounds. As a result of this slowness in
manufacture there was always in primitive and
ancient times a scarcity of iron. Indeed in some
countries iron was a precious metal, almost as
precious as silver or gold. In many countries, it is
true, there were thousands of forges at work, but
in no country was the supply of iron equal to the demand.
The old forge could not supply the demand,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>yet centuries passed before any great improvement
was made in the progress of iron making.</p>

  FIG. 6.&mdash;A BLAST FURNACE OF THE MIDDLE
  AGES.
</div>

<p>Near the close of the Middle Ages improvements
upon the primitive
forge began
to be made.
In the sixteenth
century ironmakers
in Germany
began to
smelt ore in
closed furnaces
and to build
their furnaces
higher and to
make them
larger <span class="locked">(Fig. 6).</span>
Sometimes they
built their furnaces
to a height
of twenty or
thirty feet.
About this time
also a better
and a stronger
blast was invented.
Water-power
instead of hand-power began to be used for
operating the bellows. In some cases wooden bellows&mdash;great
wooden pistons working in tubs&mdash;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>were
substituted for the old bellows of leather. By
the end of the sixteenth century so many improvements
had been made upon the primitive forge that
it no longer resembled the forge of ancient times.
So the new forge received a new name and was called
a <span class="locked"><i>blast furnace</i>.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></span> You should observe, however,
that the blast furnace was simply the old forge built
with a large closed furnace and provided with a
more powerful blast.</p>

<p>The invention of the blast furnace marked the
beginning of a new era in the history of iron making.
In the first place there was produced in the
blast furnace a kind of iron that was entirely different
from that which was produced in the primitive
forge. In the primitive forge there was made
a lump of practically pure unmelted iron, known as
wrought iron. In the blast furnace there was produced
a somewhat impure grade of melted iron,
known as <i>cast</i> iron, or <span class="locked"><i>pig</i><a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">11</a></span> iron. In the second
place, the blast furnace produced iron in quantities
vastly greater than it was ever produced by the old
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>forge. In the blast furnace more iron could be made
in a day than could be made by the forge in a month.
In some of the early blast furnaces a thousand
pounds of iron could be made at one melting and we
read of one early furnace that produced 150 tons of
iron in a year.</p>

  FIG. 7.&mdash;MAKING CHARCOAL.
</div>

<p>But even with the blast furnace it was still difficult
to make enough iron to supply the ever-increasing
demands of the industrial world. In the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries machinery was
brought into use more than ever before and of course
more iron was needed for the construction of the
machines. There was ore enough for all the iron
that was needed but it was difficult to get fuel enough
to smelt the ore. Charcoal was still used as the
fuel for smelting <span class="locked">(Fig. 7),</span> and in order to get wood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
for the charcoal great inroads were made upon the
forests. In England in the early part of the eighteenth
century Parliament had to put a check upon
the manufacture of iron in certain counties in order
to save the forests of those counties from utter
destruction. It then became plain that if iron making
were to be continued on a large scale a new kind
of fuel would have to be used in the furnaces. So
men set their wits to work to find a new kind of fuel.
As far back as 1619 Dud Dudley in the county of
Warwick, England, undertook to use ordinary soft
coal in his furnaces but his experiment was not very
successful or very profitable. More than a century
after this an English ironmaker named Abraham
Darby began (in 1735) to use <i>charred coal</i> in his
blast furnaces, and his experiments were successful.
Here was the new fuel which was so badly needed.
Charred coal is simply <i>coke</i> and coke could be had
in abundance. So the new fuel was soon used in
all parts of England and by the end of the eighteenth
century coke was driving charcoal out of blast furnaces
<span class="locked">(Fig. 8).</span></p>

  FIG. 9.&mdash;A MODERN BLAST FURNACE.
</div>

<p>About the time the use of coke for smelting became
general, an Englishman named Neilson brought
about another great change in the process of iron
making. Before Neilson's time the blast driven into
the furnace had always been one of cold air. Neilson
learned that if the air before entering the furnace
were heated to a temperature of 600 degrees it would
melt twice the amount of ore and thus produce twice<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
the amount of iron without any increase in the amount
of fuel. So he invented (in 1828) a <i>hot blast</i> for
the blast furnace <span class="locked">(Fig. 9).</span> With the use of coke
and with the hot blast the production of iron increased
enormously. But there was need for all the iron that
could be made. Indeed it seems that the world can
never get too much iron. About the time the hot
blast was invented iron chains instead of ropes began
to be used for holding anchors, iron plows
began to be made in great numbers (p. 83), iron
pipes instead of hollow wooden logs began to be used
as water-mains in cities, and iron rails began to be
used on railroads. To supply iron for all these
purposes kept ironmakers busy enough, even though
they burned coke in their furnaces and made use of
the hot air blast.</p>

<p>But ironmakers were soon to become busier than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
ever before. About the middle of the nineteenth
century Sir Henry Bessemer invented a new process
of making steel. Steel is only iron mixed with a
small amount of carbon. Ironmakers have known
how to make steel&mdash;and good steel, too&mdash;for thousands
of years, but before the days of Bessemer the
process had always been slow and tedious, and the
cost of steel had always been very great. Bessemer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>undertook to make steel in large quantities and at
low prices. In his experiments amid showers of
molten metal he often risked his life, but his perseverance
and courage were rewarded. By 1858 he
had invented a process by which tons of molten iron
could be run into a furnace and in a few minutes be
converted into a fine quality of steel. This invention
of Bessemer was the last great step in the history of
the forge.</p>

<p>Now that steel could be made in great quantities
and at a low cost it was put to uses never dreamed
of in former times. Soon the railroad rail was made
of steel <span class="locked">(Fig. 10),</span> bridges were made of steel, ships
of war were plated with steel. Then ocean grayhounds
and battleships were made of steel, still later
steel freight cars and steel passenger coaches were introduced,
while in our own time we see vast quantities
of steel used in the building of houses. So while
the invention of Bessemer marked the last step in the
history of the forge it also marked the ending of the
Age of Iron and the beginning of the wonderful age
in which we live&mdash;the Age of Steel.</p>

How important this use is, how much of the world's

what does steam do? Its services are so many you

<p>That steam has the power to move things must
have been learned almost as soon as fire was used
to boil water. Heat water until it boils and the
steam that is formed is bound to move something
unless it is allowed to escape freely. It will burst
the vessel if an outlet is not provided. That is why
a spout has been placed on the tea-kettle. Where
there is cooking, steam is abundant and the first experiments
in steam were doubtless made in the kitchen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>

  FIG. 2.&mdash;HERO'S ENGINE, 120 B.&nbsp;C.
</div>

<p>Whatever may have happened in ancient kitchens,
we are certain that there were no steam-engines
until many centuries after Adam. The beginnings
of this invention are not shrouded in so much mystery
as are those of the match and the lamp and the
forge. In giving an
account of the steam-engine
we can mention
names and give
dates from the very
beginning of the
story. We know
what the first steam-engine
was like and
we know who made
it and when and
where it was made.
It was made 120 <span class="smallish smcap locked">B.&nbsp;C.</span>
by Hero, a philosopher of Alexandria in Egypt.
It was like the one shown in <span class="locked">Figure 2.</span> The boy
applies the fire to the steam-tight vessel <i>p</i> and when
steam is formed it passes up through the tube <i>o</i> and
enters the globe which turns easily on the pivots.
The steam, when it has filled the globe, rushes out of
the short tubes <i>w</i> and <i>z</i> projecting from opposite
sides of the globe and bent at the end in opposite
directions. As it rushes out of the tubes the steam<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
strikes against the air and the reaction causes the
globe to revolve, just as in yards we sometimes see
jets of water causing bent tubes to revolve. This
was Hero's engine, the first steam-engine ever made.</p>

<p>Hero's engine was used only as a toy and it seems<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
to represent all the ancients knew about the power of
steam and all they did with it. It is not strange that
they did not know more for there is no general rule
by which discoveries are made. Sometimes even
enlightened peoples have for centuries remained blind
to the simplest principles of nature. The Greeks and
Romans with all their culture and wisdom were ignorant
of some of the plainest facts of science. It
is a little strange, however, that after Hero's discovery
was made known, men did not profit by it.
It would seem that eager and persistent attempts
would have been made at once to have steam do useful
work, as well as furnish amusement. But such
was not the case. Hero's countrymen paid but little
attention to his invention and the steam-engine passed
almost completely out of men's minds and did not
again attract attention for nearly seventeen hundred
years.</p>

  FIG. 3.&mdash;BRANCA'S ENGINE, 1629.
</div>

<p>About the end of the fifteenth century Europe
began to awaken from a long slumber and by the end
of the sixteenth century its eyes were wide open.
Everywhere men were now trying to learn all they
could. The study of steam was taken up in earnest
about the middle of the sixteenth century and by the
middle of the next century quite a little had been
learned of its nature and power. In 1629 an Italian,
Branca by name, described in a book a steam-engine
which would furnish power for pounding drugs in
a mortar. There was no more need for such a
machine then than there is now and of course the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
inventor aroused no interest in his engine. You
can easily understand how Branca's engine <span class="locked">(Fig.
3)</span> works. The steam causes the wheels and the
cylinder to revolve. As the cylinder revolves, a
cleat on it catches a cleat on the pestle and lifts the
pestle a short distance and then lets it fall. Here
the pestle instead of being raised by a human hand
is raised by the force of steam. This engine would
be more interesting if an engine had actually been
made, but there is no reason to believe that Branca
ever made the engine he described. We owe much
to him, nevertheless, for suggesting how steam might
be put to doing useful work.</p>

  FIG. 4.&mdash;WORCESTER'S ENGINE, 1663.
</div>

<p>It was not very long before an Englishman put
into practice what the Italian had only suggested.
Edward Somerset, the Second Marquis of Worcester,
in 1663 built a steam-engine that raised to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
the height of forty feet four large buckets of water
in four minutes of time. This was the first useful
work ever done by steam. <span class="locked">Figure 4</span> shows the construction
of Worcester's engine.</p>

<p>In this engine there was one improvement over
former engines which
was of the greatest
importance: there
was one vessel in
which the steam was
generated and another
in which the
steam did its work.
The steam-engine
now consisted of two
great divisions, the
boiler and the engine
proper.</p>

  FIG. 5.&mdash;AN ANCIENT METHOD OF DRAWING WATER.
</div>

<p>Worcester spent a
large part of his
fortune in trying to
improve the steam-engine,
yet he received
neither profit
nor honor as a reward.
He died poor and his name was soon forgotten.
His service to the world was nevertheless very
great. In his time the mines of England had been
sunk very deep into the earth; and the deeper they
were sunk the greater was the difficulty of lifting the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
water out of them and keeping them dry. The
water was lifted up from the mines by means of
buckets drawn by horses or oxen <span class="locked">(Fig. 5).</span> Sometimes
it took several hundred horses to keep the water
out of a single mine. It was Worcester's object to
construct an engine that would do the work of the
horses. The engine he built could not do this, yet it
furnished the idea&mdash;and the idea is often the most
important thing. It was not long before engines
built upon Worcester's plan were doing useful work
at the mines. At the opening of the eighteenth
century the steam-engine had been put to work and
was serving man in England and throughout the continent
of Europe.</p>

  FIG. 6.&mdash;PAPIN'S ENGINE, 1690.
</div>

<p>The first engines were not safe. Often the steam
pressed too heavily upon the sides of the vessel in
which it was compressed and there were explosions.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
About 1680 Denis Papin, a Frenchman, invented the
<i>safety valve</i>, that is a valve that opens of its own
accord and lets out steam when there is more in the
vessel than ought to be there. About ten years later
Papin gave the world another most valuable idea.
In Worcester's engine the steam in the steam chest
pressed directly on the water that was to be forced
up. Papin showed a better way. He invented the
engine shown in <span class="locked">Figure 6.</span> In
this engine a small quantity of
water was placed in the bottom
of the cylinder <i>A</i>. Fitting
closely in the cylinder was a <i>piston</i>
<i>B</i> such as Papin had seen
used in ordinary pumps. We
will suppose that the piston is
near the bottom of the cylinder
and that a fire is built underneath.
The bottom being
made of very thin metal the
water is rapidly converted into steam and thus drives
the piston up to the top as shown in the figure.
Here a latch <i>E</i> catches the piston-rod <i>H</i> and holds
the piston up until it is time for it to descend. Now
the fire is removed and the steam, becoming cold, is
condensed and a vacuum is formed below the piston.
The latch <i>E</i> now releases the rod <i>H</i> and the piston
is driven down by the air above it, pulling with it
the rope <i>L</i> which passes over the pulleys <i>TT</i>. As
the rope descends it lifts a weight <i>W</i> or does other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
useful work. As the inventor of the piston Papin
ranks among the greatest of those whose names are
connected with the development of the steam-engine.</p>

  FIG. 7.&mdash;NEWCOMEN'S ENGINE, 1705.
</div>

<p>Our story has now brought us to the early part
of the eighteenth century. Everywhere men were
now trying to make the most of the ideas of Worcester
and Papin. The mines were growing very
deep. As the water in them was getting beyond
control something extraordinary had to be done.
Now it seems that whenever the world is in need of an
extraordinary service someone is found to render
that service. The man who built the engine that
was needed was a humble blacksmith of Dartmouth,
England, Thomas Newcomen. This master
mechanic in 1705 constructed the best steam-engine
the world had yet seen. We must study Newcomen's
engine <span class="locked">(Fig. 7)</span> very carefully. The large beam
<i>ii</i> moved freely up and down on the pivot <i>v</i>. One
end of the beam was connected with the heavy pump-rod
<i>k</i> by means of a rope or chain working in a
groove and the other end was connected with the
rod <i>r</i> in the same way. When steam from the boiler
<i>b</i> passed through the valve <i>d</i> into the cylinder (steam-chest)
<i>a</i> it raised the piston <i>s</i> and with it the piston-rod
<i>r</i> thus slackening the rope and allowing the opposite
end of the beam to be pulled down by the
weight of the pump-rod <i>k</i>. As soon as the piston
<i>s</i> reached the top of the cylinder the steam was shut
off by means of the valve <i>d</i> and the valve <i>f</i> was turned
and a jet of cold water from the tank <i>g</i> was injected<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
into the cylinder <i>a</i> with the steam. The jet of cold
water condensed the steam rapidly&mdash;steam is
always condensed rapidly when anything cold comes
in contact with it&mdash;and the water formed by the
condensation escaped through the pipe <i>p</i> into the tank
<i>o</i>. As soon as the steam in <i>a</i> is condensed, a vacuum
was formed in the cylinder and the atmosphere above
forced the piston down and at the same time pulled
the pump-rod <i>k</i> up and lifted water from the well or
mine. When the piston reached the bottom of
the cylinder the valve <i>d</i> was opened and the piston
again ascended. Thus the beam is made to go up
and down and the pumping goes on. Notice that
steam pushes the piston one way and the atmosphere
pushes it back.</p>

  FIG. 8.&mdash;HUMPHREY POTTER'S LATCHES AND STRINGS.
</div>

<p>In Newcomen's engine the valves (<i>f</i> and <i>d</i>) at first
were opened and shut (at each stroke of the piston)
by an attendant, usually a boy. In 1713 a boy
named Humphrey Potter, in order to get some time
for play, by means of strings and latches, caused
the beam in its motion to open and shut the valves
without human aid. We must not despise Humphrey
because his purpose was to gain time for play. The
purpose of almost all inventions is to save human
labor so that men may have more time for amusement
and rest. Humphrey Potter ought to be remembered
not as a lazy boy but as a great inventor.
His strings and latches improved the engine
wonderfully <span class="locked">(Fig. 8).</span> Before his invention the
piston made only six or eight strokes a minute; after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
the valves were made to open and shut by the motion
of the beam, it made fifteen or sixteen strokes a
minute and the engine did more than twice as much
work.</p>

<p>Newcomen's engine as improved by Potter and
others grew rapidly into favor. It was used most
commonly to pump water out of the mines but it
was put to other uses. In and about London it was
used to supply water to large houses and in 1752
a flour mill near Bristol was driven by a steam-engine.
In Holland Newcomen's engines were used to assist
the wind-mills in draining lakes.</p>

  FIG. 10.&mdash;WATT'S ENGINE.
</div>

<p>For nearly seventy-five years engines were everywhere
built after the Newcomen pattern. Improvements
in a small way were added now and then but
no very important change was made until the latter
part of the eighteenth century, when the steam-engine
was made by James Watt practically what it is to-day.
This great inventor spent years in making improvements
upon Newcomen's engine <span class="locked">(Fig. 9)</span> and when
his labors were finished he had done more for the
steam-engine than any man who ever lived. We must
try to learn <i>what</i> he did. We can learn what Watt
did by studying <span class="locked">Figure 10.</span> Here P is a piston working
in a cylinder A <i>closed at both ends</i>. By the
side of the cylinder is a <i>valve-chest</i> C into which
steam passes from the pipe T. Connecting C with
the cylinder there are <i>two</i> openings, one at the top
of the cylinder and the other at the bottom. The
valve-chest is provided with valves which are worked
by means of the rod F, which moves up and down
with the beam B, thanks to Humphrey Potter for the
hint. The valves are so arranged that when steam
enters the opening at the top of the cylinder it is
shut off from the opening at the bottom, and when
it enters the opening at the bottom it is shut off
from the opening at the top. When the opening
at the bottom is closed the steam will rush in at the
upper opening and push the piston downward; when
the piston has nearly reached the bottom of the cylinder
the upper opening will be closed and steam will
rush in at the bottom of the steam chest and push<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
the piston upwards. Here was <i>one</i> of the things
done by Watt for the engine: he contrived to make
the steam push the piston down as well as up. You
have observed that in Newcomen's engine steam was
used only to push the piston <i>up</i>, the atmosphere being
relied upon to push it down. Thus we may say that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Watt's engine was the first <i>real steam-engine</i>, for it
was the first that was worked entirely by steam. All
engines before it had been worked partly by steam
and partly by air.</p>

<p>Watt's greatest improvement upon the steam-engine
is yet to be mentioned. In Newcomen's
engine when the cold water was injected into the cylinder
it cooled the piston and when steam was let into
the cylinder again a part of it, striking the cold piston,
was condensed before it had time to do any work and
the power of this part of the steam was lost. Watt
did not allow the piston to get cold, for he did not
inject any cold water into the cylinder. In his engine
as soon as the steam did its work it was carried off
through the pipe <i>M</i> to the vessel <i>N</i> and there condensed
by means of a jet of water which was injected
into <i>N</i> (called the <i>condenser</i>) by means of a pump
<i>E</i> worked by the motion of the beam, thanks again
to Humphrey Potter for the idea. This condensation
of the steam outside of the cylinder and at a
distance from it prevented the piston (and cylinder)
from getting cold. In other words, in the Watt engine
when steam entered the cylinder it went straight
to work pushing the piston. No steam was lost and
no power was lost and the cost of running the engine
was greatly reduced.</p>

<p>It cannot be said that Watt invented the steam-engine&mdash;no
one can claim that honor&mdash;yet he did
so much to make it better that he well deserves the
epitaph which is inscribed on his monument in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>

<p>But the story of the steam-engine does not end
with Watt. It will be remembered that in the engines
of Nero and of Branca the steam did its work
by reaction or by impulse. Now soon after the time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span>
of Watt, inventors turned their thoughts to the old
engines of Nero and Branca and began to experiment
with engines that would do their work by a direct
impact of steam. After nearly a century of experimenting
and after many failures there was at last
developed an engine known as the <i>steam-turbine</i>.
In this engine the steam does its work by impinging
or pushing directly upon blades <span class="locked">(Fig. 11)</span> which
are connected with the shaft which is to be turned,
and it does this in much the same manner that we saw
the steam do its work in Branca's engine. One of
the greatest names connected with the steam turbine
is that of Charles Algernon Parsons of England.
In 1884 this great inventor patented a steam-turbine
which proved to be a commercial success and since
that date the steam-turbine has been constantly grow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>ing
in favor. So great has been its success on land
and on sea that there are those who believe that the
engine invented by Watt will in time be cast aside
and that its place will be taken by an engine which
is the most ancient as well as the most modern of
steam motors.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_PLOW" id="THE_PLOW">THE PLOW</a></h2>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">Y</span>ou have now learned the history of those inventions
which enabled man to gain a mastery over
fire and to use it for his comfort and convenience.
We shall next learn the history of an invention
which gave man the mastery of the soil and enabled
him to take from the earth priceless treasures of
fruit and grain. This invention was the plow.</p>

<p>In his earliest state man had no use for the plow
because he did not look to the soil as a place from
which he was to get his food. The first men were
hunters and they relied upon the chase for their food.
They roamed from place to place in pursuit of
their prey&mdash;the birds and beasts of the forest and the
fishes of the stream. They did not remain long
enough in one spot to sow seed and to reap the harvest.
Still in their wanderings they found wheat
and barley growing wild and they ate of the seeds
of these plants and learned that the little grains were
good for food. They learned, too, that if the seeds
were planted in a soil that was well stirred the plants
would grow better than they would if the seeds were
planted in hard ground. So by the time men had
grown tired of wandering about and were ready to
settle down and live in one spot they had learned two<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
important facts: they knew they could add to their
food supply by tilling the soil, and they knew that
they could grow better crops if they would stir the
soil before planting the seed.</p>

  FIG. 1.&mdash;THE KATTA OR DIGGING STICK.
</div>

<p>For the stirring of the soil the primitive farmer
doubtless first used a sharpened stick such as wandering
tribes carry for the purpose of digging up eatable
roots, knocking fruits down from trees, and breaking
the heads of enemies. Such a stick known as the
<i>Katta</i> <span class="locked">(Fig. 1)</span> is carried by certain tribes in Australia,
and we are told by travelers that the Kurubars
of Southern India use a sharp stick when digging up
the ground. The digging stick is used by savages in
many parts of the world
and we may regard it as
the oldest of implements
used for tilling the soil.</p>

  FIG. 2.&mdash;THE FIRST PLOW.
</div>

<p>The first plow was a
forked stick or a limb of a
tree with a projecting point
<span class="locked">(Fig. 2).</span> With this implement
the ground was
broken not by digging but by dragging the fork
or projecting point of the stick through the
ground and forming a continuous furrow. In this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
forked stick we see two of the principal parts
of the modern plow. The fork of the stick is the
<i>share</i>, or cutting part of the plow, while the main part
of the stick is the <i>beam</i>.</p>

<p>An improvement upon the simple forked stick is
seen in <span class="locked">Figure 3,</span> which is copied from an ancient
monument in Syria (in Asia Minor). The old Syrian
plow consists almost wholly of the natural crooks of
a branch of a tree, the only artificial piece being the
brace e which connects the share and the beam and
holds them firm. In this crooked stick we have
three of the main parts of the modern plow, the
beam (a), the share (c-b) and the handle (d). The
plow in this form requires the services of two persons&mdash;one
to draw the plow and one to guide it and
keep it in the ground. It is said that it was with a
plow of this kind that the servants of Job were
plowing when they were driven from their fields by
the Sabeans.</p>

of ancient Egypt, the country which seems to have
been the first home of the plow, we have a plowing
scene which shows a number
of men dragging a
plow by means of a rope.
But primitive man was not
at all fond of labor and in
the course of time he tamed
wild bulls and horses and
made them draw the plows.
So upon another Egyptian
monument of a later date we have a picture of a
plowing scene in which animals are drawing the plow
<span class="locked">(Fig. 5).</span> In this Egyptian plow we see improvements
upon the crooked stick of the Syrians. The
Egyptian plow, you observe, has a broader share.
It will, therefore, make a wider furrow and will plow
more ground. Moreover, it has two handles instead
of one. Taking it
altogether, the
Egyptian plow was
a fairly good implement.</p>

  FIG. 7.&mdash;AN OLD SAXON PLOW, 1000 A.&nbsp;D.
</div>

<p>Many centuries
passed before any
real improvement
was made upon the old Egyptian plow. If there
were any improvement anywhere it was among
the Romans. We read in Pliny&mdash;a Roman writer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
of the first century&mdash;of a plow that had wheels to
regulate the depth of the plow and also a <i>coulter</i>,
that is, a knife
fixed in front of the
share to make the
first cut of the sod
<span class="locked">(Fig. 6).</span> But such
a plow was not in
general use in
Pliny's time. A
thousand years
later, however, the
plow with wheels
and coulter was doubtless in common use. In a picture
taken from an old Saxon print we see <span class="locked">(Fig. 7)</span> a
plow which was used in the time of William the Conqueror
(1066). Here the plow has a coulter inserted
in the beam and there are two wheels to regulate
the depth to which the plow may go. This
Saxon plow is drawn by four fine oxen and it is
plainly a great improvement upon the old Egyptian
plow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
But improvements in the plow during the dark
ages came very slowly. At the time of the discovery
of America the plow was still the clumsy wooden
thing it was five hundred years before. In the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries, however, when improvements
were being made in so many things, it
was natural that men should begin to think of trying
to improve the plow. In an old book published
in 1652 we read of a double plow&mdash;one which
would plow two furrows at one time. A picture
<span class="locked">(Fig. 8)</span> of the double plow is given in the book but
there is no proof that such a plow was ever made or
ever used. The world did not as yet need a double
plow, although the time was to come when it would
need one.</p>

  (This plow was proposed but was never made.)
</div>

<p>In the early part of the eighteenth century we
begin to see real improvements in plow making.
About this time Dutch plowmakers began to put
<i>mold-boards</i> on their plows. The purpose of the
mold-board is to lift up and turn over the slice of
sod cut by the share. Without the mold-board the
plow simply runs through the ground and stirs it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
up. With the mold-board of the Dutch plow <span class="locked">(Fig.
9)</span> the sod was turned completely over and the weeds
and grass were covered up. This was the kind of
plow that was needed, for if the weeds and grass
are not covered up the best effects of plowing are
lost. So the mold-board was a great improvement
and its invention marks a great event in the history
of the plow.</p>

  FIG. 10.&mdash;A COLONIAL PLOW.
</div>

<p>The Dutch plow was taken as a model for English
plows and, in fact, for the plows of all nations. The
mold-board grew rapidly into favor and by the end
of the eighteenth century it was found on plows in
all civilized nations. But the plow was still made
mostly of wood <span class="locked">(Fig. 10)</span> and it was still an awkward
and a poorly constructed affair. The method
of making plows about the year 1800 has been
described as follows: "A mold-board was hewed
from a tree with the grain of the timber running
as nearly along its shape as it could well be obtained.
On to this mold-board, to prevent its wearing out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
too rapidly, were nailed the blade of an old hoe,
thin strips of iron, or worn out horseshoes <span class="locked">(Fig. 10).</span>
The land side was of wood, its base and sides shod
with thin plates of iron. The share was of iron with
a hardened steel point. The coulter was
tolerably well made of iron. The beam was
usually a straight stick. The handles, like
the mold-board, were split from the crooked
trunk of a tree
or as often cut
from its
branches. The beam
was set at any pitch that
fancy might dictate, with
the handles fastened on
almost at right angles with it, thus leaving the plowman
little control over his implement, which did its
work in a very slow and most imperfect manner."</p>

<p>But about the end of the eighteenth century the
world was beginning to need a plow that would do
its work rapidly and well. Population was everywhere
increasing and it was necessary to till more
ground than had ever been tilled in former times.
Especially was a good plow needed in the United
States where there were vast areas of new ground to
be broken. And it was in the United States that the
first great improvements in the plow were made.
Foremost among those who helped to make the plow
a better implement was the statesman, Thomas Jefferson.
This great man while traveling in France<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span>
in 1788 was struck by the clumsiness of the plows
used in that country. In his diary he wrote: "The
awkward figure of their mold-board leads one to
consider what should be its form." So Jefferson
turned his attention to mold-boards. He saw that
the mold-board ought to be so shaped that it would
move through the ground and turn the sod with the
least possible resistance and he planned for a mold-board
of this kind. By 1793 he had determined
what the proper form of a mold-board should be
and had in actual use on his estate in Virginia several
plows which had mold-boards of least resistance.
Mr. Jefferson's patterns of the mold-board have, of
course, been improved upon, but he has the honor
of having invented the first mold-board that was
constructed according to scientific and mathematical
<span class="locked">principles.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">12</a></span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>
<p>About the time Jefferson was working upon the
mold-board, Charles Newbold, a farmer of Burlington,
New Jersey, was also doing great things
for the improvement of the plow. We have seen
that the plow of this time was a patch work of wood
and iron. Newbold thought the plow ought to be
made wholly of iron and about 1796 he made one
of cast iron, the point, share, and mold-board all
being cast in one piece. But the New Jersey farmers
did not take kindly to the iron plow. They said
that iron poisoned the crops and caused weeds to
grow faster than ever. So Newbold could not sell
his plows and he was compelled to give up the business
in despair.</p>

  FIG. 12.&mdash;JETHRO WOOD'S PLOW, 1819.
</div>

<p>But soon the iron plow was to have its day. In
1819 Jethro Wood of Scipio, New York, took out<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
a patent for a plow which was made of cast iron and
which combined the best features of the plow as
planned by Jefferson and by Newbold. In Wood's
plow <span class="locked">(Fig. 12)</span> the several parts&mdash;the point, share
and mold-board&mdash;were so fastened together that
when one piece wore out it could easily be replaced
by a new piece. In Newbold's plow when one part
wore out the whole plow was rendered useless.
Wood's plow became very popular and by 1825 it
was rapidly driving out the half-wooden, half-iron
plows of the olden time. Great improvements of
course have been made upon the plow since 1819, but
in the main features the best plows of to-day closely
resemble the implement invented by Jethro Wood.
Since our greatness as a nation is due largely to the
plow all honor should be given to the memory of
this inventor. "No citizen of the United States,"
said William H. Seward, "has conferred greater
benefits on his country than Jethro Wood."</p>

</div>

<p>But the plow of Jethro Wood, as excellent as it
was, did not fully meet the needs of the western
farmer. The sod of the vast prairies could not be
broken fast enough with a plow of a single share.
So about the middle of the nineteenth century the
<i>gang plow</i>, a hint for which had been given long before
<span class="locked">(p. 78)</span> was invented, and as this new plow
moved along three or four or five furrows were
turned at once. At first the gang plow was drawn
by horses <span class="locked">(Fig. 13)</span> but later it was drawn by steam
<span class="locked">(Fig. 14).</span></p>

<p>The great gang plow drawn by steam marked the
last step in the development of the plow. The
forked stick drawn by human hands and making its
feeble scratch on the ground had grown until it had
become a mighty machine drawn across the field by
an unseen force and leaving in its wake a broad belt
of deeply-plowed and well-broken soil.</p>

<p>The first grain was doubtless cut with the rude
straight knives used by primitive man. In time it
was found that
if the knife
were bent it
would cut the
grain better. So the first form of the reaper was a
curved or bent knife known as the sickle or reaping
hook <span class="locked">(Fig. 1).</span> The knife was fastened at one end
to a stick which served as
a handle. When using
the sickle the harvester
held the grain in one hand
and cut it with the other.
<span class="locked">(Fig. 2).</span></p>

<p><i>When</i> the sickle first

age" <span class="locked">(p. 39)</span> are implements of flint which resemble
the sickle, while among the remains of the so-called
"bronze age" many primitive sickles made of bronze
have been found. Nor do we know <i>where</i> the sickle
was first used, although Egypt seems to have been
the first home of the sickle just as it was the first
home of the plow. Upon the wall of a building of
ancient Thebes is a picture of an Egyptian harvest
scene. Two men with sickles are cutting the wheat.
A man following the reapers seems to be gleaning,
that is, picking up the wheat that the reapers have
cut. Other harvesters are carrying the grain to the
threshing place where it is tramped out by the slow
feet of oxen. A primitive sickle such as was used by
the Egyptians was used by all civilized nations in
ancient times, by the Hebrews, by the Greeks, and
by the Romans.</p>

the Roman farmers, who were at the time the
best farmers in the world, began to use a kind of
scythe for cutting grass. The Roman scythe was
simply an improved form of the sickle; it was a
broad, heavy blade fastened on a long straight
handle, resembling the pruning hook of to-day <span class="locked">(Fig.

was used chiefly for cutting grass.</p>

<p>For more than a thousand years after the appearance

everywhere neglected and little or no improvement
was made in farming implements. About the end of
the Middle Ages, however, improvements in the form
of the scythe began to appear. In Flanders farmers
began to use an implement known as the Hainault
scythe <span class="locked">(Fig. 4).</span> This scythe had a fine broad
blade and a curved handle. When reaping with this
scythe the reaper with his left hand brought the
stalks of grain together with a hook and with
his right hand he swung the scythe and cut the grain.
This scythe was an improvement upon the sickle but

  FIG. 5.&mdash;EARLY FORM OF THE CRADLE SCYTHE.
</div>

<p>The Hainault or Flemish scythe was followed by
the <i>cradle scythe</i>. On this scythe <span class="locked">(Fig. 5)</span> there were
wooden fingers running parallel to the blade. These
fingers, called the cradle, caught the grain as it was
cut and helped to leave it in a bunch. In the early
cradle-scythe the fingers were few in number and they
ran along the blade for only a part of its length,
but in America during the colonial period the cradle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
was improved
by lengthening
the fingers and
increasing their
number. At
the time of the
Revolution the
improved
American
cradle was
coming into use and by the end of the eighteenth
century it was driving out the sickle.</p>

  FIG. 6.&mdash;THE IMPROVED CRADLE SCYTHE.

<p>But even the excellent American cradle-scythe could
not meet the needs of the American farmer. The
cast iron plow which was brought into use in the
early part of the nineteenth century <span class="locked">(p. 82)</span> made
it possible to raise fields of wheat vastly larger than
had ever been raised before. But it was of no use
to raise great fields
of grain unless the
crop could be properly
harvested.
Wheat must be cut
just when it is ripe
and the harvest season
lasts only a few
days. If the broad
American fields
were to be plowed
and planted there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
would have to be a reaping machine that would
cut the grain faster than human hands could cut it
with the scythe <span class="locked">(Fig. 6).</span></p>

  FIG. 7.&mdash;THE FIRST REAPING MACHINE, <span class="locked">70 A.&nbsp;D.</span>
</div>

<p>So about the year 1800 inventors in Europe and in
America took up the task of inventing a new kind
of reaper. The first attempts were made in England
where population was increasing very fast and
where large quantities of grain were needed to feed
the people. The first hints for a reaper were from a
machine which was used in Gaul nearly 2,000 years
ago. Pliny, who described for us a wonderful plow
used in his time (p. 77), also describes this ancient
reaper of the Gauls. It consisted of a large hollow
frame mounted on two wheels <span class="locked">(Fig. 7).</span> At the
front of the frame there was a set of teeth which
caught the heads of grain and tore them off. The
heads were raked into the box by an attendant. The
machine was pushed along by an ox. This kind of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
machine was doubtless used in Europe for a while but
it was not a success. It passed out of use and for
many centuries it was entirely forgotten. Still, the
first English reaping machines were made after the
plan of this interesting old reaper of ancient Gaul.</p>

  FIG. 8.&mdash;OGLE'S REAPER, 1822.
</div>

<p>The most remarkable of the early reapers was one
invented by Henry Ogle, a schoolmaster of Remington,
England. In 1822 Ogle constructed a model
for a reaper which was quite different from any that
had appeared before and which bore a close resemblance
to the improved
reapers of a
later date. In
Ogle's reaper <span class="locked">(Fig.
8)</span> the horse walked
ahead beside the
standing grain, just
as it does now, and
the cutting apparatus
was at the right,
just as it is now. The cutter consisted of a
frame at the front of which was a bar of iron
armed with a row of teeth projecting forward.
Directly under the teeth lay a long straight
edged knife which was moved to and fro by means
of a crank and which cut the grain as it came
between the teeth. A reel pushed the grain toward
the knife and there was a platform upon which the
grain when cut might fall. Ogle's machine did not
meet with much success yet it holds a very high place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
in the history of reaping machines, for it had nearly
all the parts of a modern reaper.</p>

  FIG. 9.&mdash;THE FIRST MCCORMICK REAPER.
</div>

<p>English inventors did much to prepare the way for
a good reaping machine but the first really successful
reaper, the first reaper that actually reaped,
was made in the United States. In the summer of
1831, Cyrus McCormick, a young blacksmith living
in the Shenandoah Valley in Virginia, made a trial
of a reaper which
he and his father
had invented&mdash;how
much they had
learned from Ogle
we do not know&mdash;and
the trial was
successful <span class="locked">(Fig.
9).</span> With two
horses he cut six
acres of oats in an
afternoon. "Such
a thing," says Mr.
Casson in his life of McCormick, "at the time was
incredible. It was equal to the work of six laborers
with scythes or twenty-four peasants with sickles. It
was as marvelous as though a man had walked down
the street carrying a dray horse on his back."</p>

  FIG. 10.&mdash;THE KNIFE
  BLADE OF HUSSEY'S
  REAPER.
</div>

<p>Although McCormick had his reaper in successful
operation by 1831 he did not take out a patent for
the machine until 1834. One year before this (in
1833) Obed Hussey, a sailor living in Baltimore,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
took out a patent for a reaper that was successful
and that was in many respects as famous a machine
as McCormick's. So while McCormick was the first
in the field with his invention, Hussey was the first
to secure a patent. The machines
of McCormick and
Hussey were very much alike:
both had the platform, the
iron bar armed with guards
and the long knife moving to
and fro. The most remarkable
feature of Hussey's machine
was the knife which consisted
of thin triangular plates of steel sharpened on
two edges and riveted side by side upon a flat bar
<span class="locked">(Fig. 10).</span> The saw-like teeth of Hussey's knife
caught the wheat between the guards and cut it better
than any knife that had as yet appeared. Both
the McCormick reapers and the Hussey reapers were
practical and successful and each of these inventors
performed a noble part in giving the world the
reaper it needed.</p>

<p>The McCormick and the Hussey reapers gave new
life to farming in the United States. Especially was
the reaper a blessing to the Western farmers. In
1844 McCormick took a trip through the West,
passing through Ohio, Michigan, Illinois, and Iowa.
As he passed through Illinois he saw how badly the
reaper was needed. He saw great fields of ripe
wheat thrown open to be devoured by hogs and cattle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
because there were not enough laborers to harvest
the crops. The farmers had worked day and night
and their wives and children had worked but they
could not harvest the grain; they had raised more
than the scythe and sickle could cut. McCormick
saw that the West was the natural home for the
reaper and in 1847 he moved to Chicago, built a
factory, and began to make reapers. In less than a
year he had orders for 500 machines and before ten
years had passed he
had sold nearly
25,000 reapers. It
was these reapers
that caused the
frontier line to
move westward at
the rate of thirty
miles a year.</p>

  FIG. 12.&mdash;SELF-RAKING REAPER.
</div>

<p>Improvements
upon the machines
of Hussey and McCormick came thick and fast.
One of the first improvements was to remove
the grain from the platform in a better way.
With the first machines a man followed the
reaper <span class="locked">(Fig. 9)</span> and removed the grain with a
rake. Then a seat was provided and the man
sat <span class="locked">(Fig. 11)</span> on the reaper and raked off the grain.
Finally the <i>self-raking</i> reaper was invented. In this
machine, as it appeared in its completed form about
1865, the reel and rake were combined. The reel<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
consisted of a number of revolving arms each of
which carried a rake <span class="locked">(Fig. 12).</span> As the arms revolved
they not only moved the standing grain toward
the knife, but they also swept the platform and
raked off the wheat in neat bunches ready to be bound
into sheaves. So the self-raking reaper saved the
labor of the man who raked the wheat from the platform.</p>

<div class="fr-cap" style="width: 208px;">

  FIG. 13.&mdash;A SELF-BINDING REAPER.
</div>

<p>Because it saved the labor of one man the self-raking
reaper was for a time the king of reaping machines.
But it did not remain king long, for soon
there came into the harvest fields a reaper that saved
the labor of several men. This was the <i>self-binder</i>.
With the older machines, as the grain was raked off
the platform it was gathered and bound into sheaves<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
by men who followed the reaper, one reaper requiring
the services of three or four or five human binders.
With the self-binder <span class="locked">(Fig. 13)</span> the grain was
gathered into sheaves and neatly tied without the aid
of human hands. At first, wire was used in binding
the sheaves but by 1880 most self-binders were
using twine. So the self-binder saved the labor not
only of the man who raked the grain from the platform
but it saved the labor of all the binders as well.</p>

<p>The last step in the development of the reaper was
taken when the <i>complete harvester</i> was invented.
This machine cuts the standing grain, threshes it,
<span class="locked">winnows<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">13</a></span> it, and places it in sacks <span class="locked">(Fig. 14).</span> As
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>this giant reaper travels over the field one sees on
one side the cutting bar 15 to 25 feet in length slicing
its way through the wheat, while on the other
side of the machine streams of grain run into sacks
which, as fast as they are filled, are hauled to the
barn or to the nearest railway station. The complete
harvester is either drawn by horses&mdash;30 or
40 in number&mdash;or by a powerful engine. It cuts
and threshes 100 acres of wheat in a day and the
cost is less than 50 cents an acre. It does as much
work in a day as could have been done by a hundred
men before the days of McCormick. Of all the
wonderful machines used by farmers the most wonderful
is the complete harvester, the latest and the
greatest of reapers.</p>

  FIG. 1.&mdash;THE FIRST MILL.
</div>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">T</span>he first mill was a hole made in a stationary
rock <span class="locked">(Fig. 1).</span> The grain was placed in the
hole and crushed with a stone held in the hand. On
Centre street in
Trenton, New Jersey,
not many years
ago one of these
primitive mills could
still be seen and
there are evidences
that such mills once
existed in all parts
of the world. In those places where the earth
did not supply the stationary rock, stones were
brought from afar and hollowed out into cup-like
form and in these the grinding
was done.</p>

  FIG. 2.&mdash;THE KNOCKING-STANE.
</div>

<p>The mill which consisted
of a hole in a rock and a
stone in the hands was followed
by the "knocking-stane"
and mallet <span class="locked">(Fig. 2).</span>
The "knocking-stane" was
a mortar, or cup-shaped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
vessel made of stone; the mallet was usually made of
wood. The grain was placed in the mortar and
struck repeatedly with the mallet, the beating being
kept up until a coarse flour was produced. This is
an exceedingly rude method of crushing grain, yet
this is the way the people in some parts of Scotland
grind their barley at the present time.</p>

  FIG. 3.&mdash;MORTAR AND PESTLE MILL.
</div>

<p>At a very early
date the "knocking-stane"
was laid
aside for the mortar
and pestle (<span class="locked">Fig. 3</span>)
almost everywhere.
In this mill the grain
instead of being
struck with a hammer
was pounded
with a pestle. The
bottom of the pestle
was frequently covered
with iron in
which grooves were
cut. As the man
pounded he found that when he gave the pestle a
twirling or rotary motion as it fell it ground the
grain much faster. We may be sure that after this
was learned the twirling motion was always given.</p>

  FIG. 4.&mdash;THE SLAB-MILL.
</div>

<p>The mortar and pestle were followed by the slab-mill
<span class="locked">(Fig. 4).</span> Here the grain was ground by being
rubbed between two stones. Dr. Livingstone, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
great African explorer, gives the following description
of a slab-mill which he saw in operation in South
Africa. "The operator kneeling grasps the upper
millstone with both hands and works it backwards
and forwards in the hollow of the lower millstone,
in the same way that a baker works his dough.
The weight of the person is brought to bear on the
movable stone and while it is pressed and pushed
forward and backward one hand supplies every now
and then a little grain to be bruised and ground."</p>

  <img src="images/i_100.jpg" width="181" height="140" alt="" /><br />
  FIG. 5.&mdash;THE UPPER AND NETHER MILLSTONE.
</div>

<p>As we have seen, the primitive miller gradually
learned that the pestle did better work when it fell
with a twirling motion. This little bit of experience
led to important results in the development of the
mill. If the grinding were done better with a twirling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
motion, why not have as much of the twirling motion
as possible? Why not make the upper stone go
round and round? This was what was done. The
upper stone was caused to turn round and round.
The wheel-mill, the mill of the upper and nether millstone
<span class="locked">(Fig. 5),</span> was invented. When and where it
was invented we cannot tell for it was in use among all
civilized peoples
before history
began to be written.
There were
many kinds of
wheel-mills
among the nations
of antiquity
and in
principle they
were all alike
in construction.
How they worked
may be learned by studying <span class="locked">Figure 5</span> which represents
a mill used in ancient India. The upper
stone is placed upon the pivot projecting from the
center of the lower (nether) stone, and caused to
revolve by means of the handle. The grain when
placed in the hollow at the center of the upper stone
<span class="locked">(Fig. 5)</span> works its way down between the stones and
comes out at the circumference ground, bran and
flour together. The mill was fed with grain by the
operator. The first hopper was a human hand.</p>

  FIG. 12.&mdash;SHOWING THE INTERIOR OF THE FIRST
  WATER-MILL.
</div>

<p>The Pompeian
mill shows that as
early as the first
century the Romans
ground their grain
by animal power.
Indeed about this time a still greater change was made
in the method of grinding grain. When Julius Cæsar
flourished (50 <span class="smallish smcap locked">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) men began to harness the
power of running water and make it turn their
mills <span class="locked">(Fig. 11).</span> From <span class="locked">Figure 12</span> we may easily
learn how this was done. The running water turns
the wheel and in doing so turns the upper millstone.
A hopper is suspended from the roof by
ropes. Through this the grain passes into the mill.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>Here was a great saving in human labor and a
great advancement in mill making. A Roman writer
of Cæsar's time appreciating how great a blessing
was the invention of the water-mill exclaimed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
Ye maids who toiled so faithful at the mill<br />
Now cease from work and from these toils be still;<br />
Sleep now till dawn and let the birds with glee<br />
Sing to the ruddy morn, on bush and tree;<br />
For what your hands performed so long, so true,<br />
<span class="locked">Ceres<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">15</a></span> has charged the water-nymphs to do;<br />
They come, the limpid sisters, to her call,<br />
And on the wheel with dashing fury fall;<br />
Impel the axle with a whirling sound<br />
And make the massive millstone reel around<br />
And bring the floury heap luxuriant to the ground.<br />
</div></div>

<p>Nothing can be simpler than the water-mill described
above; it was the old mill of the upper and
nether millstones, the old hand mill turned by water.
That was all. Yet, as simple as it was, many centuries
passed after its invention before a new principle
in flour making was discovered. There were inventions
for lowering and raising the stone so as to
grind finer or coarser as might be desired, and there
were improvements in the kind of water wheels employed,
and better methods of sifting the flour from
the bran were discovered from time to time, but the
water-mill invented in the time of Julius Cæsar remained
practically unchanged until the early part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>the nineteenth century, when the last step in the
development of the mill was <span class="locked">taken.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></span></p>

  FIG. 13.&mdash;AN EARLY FLOUR
  ROLLER-MILL.
</div>

<p>About 1810 millers in Austria, more particularly
those in Vienna, began to grind their grain by passing
it between two horizontal rollers <span class="locked">(Fig. 13).</span> The
rollers were spirally grooved
and turned toward each
other. There was a wide
difference between this process
and the one to which the
world was accustomed, yet
the new method was found
to be better than the old one.
Austrian flour and Austrian
bread became famous. The
delicious Vienna bread on our tables of course has
never seen Vienna. It is called "Vienna bread"
because it is made out of a kind of flour which
was first ground in the Austrian capital. The
Austrian way of grinding grew rapidly into favor
among millers everywhere. In the United States
where there was so much wheat to be ground the
roller process was taken up eagerly and improved
upon as only Americans know how to improve upon
an idea. In the flour mills of the West the grain
was soon passing through a series of rollers. By
the first pair of rollers the grain was simply cracked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>into pieces somewhat coarse. Then after being
bolted (sifted) it was passed between a second pair of
rollers and reduced to a greater fineness. Then it
was bolted again and passed between a third pair of
rollers. The rolling and sifting continued until a
practically pure flour was obtained. A pure flour
is the modern miller's ideal. He wants a branless
flour and a flourless bran. The old stone mill could
not grind this kind of flour. Before the roller mill<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
appeared there was always bran in the flour and
flour in the bran.</p>

  FIG. 14.&mdash;A MODERN FLOUR ROLLER-MILL.
</div>

<p>The invention of the flour roller-mill <span class="locked">(Fig. 14)</span>
is the last step in the development of the mill. The
roller process has almost entirely driven out all other
processes. Now and then we see by the roadside
an old fashioned mill with the upper and nether
stone, but we seldom see one that is prosperous
and thriving. Millers, like everybody else in these
days, do business on a large scale and to make flour
on a large scale they must use the roller-mill. Thus
the hole in the rock in which a handful of grain was
laboriously crushed has, through long ages of growth,
become the great factory in which thousands of barrels
of flour are made in a day.</p>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">H</span>ave you ever seen a loom? It would not be a
wonder if you have not. In these days the
average person seldom sees one. Everyone knows in
a vague sort of way that clothes and carpets are made
of wool or silk or cotton, as the case may be, and
that they are woven upon an instrument called a loom.
This is about as much as we usually know about the
clothes we wear or the carpets we walk upon. We
buy these things from the store and that is all there
is to it. In the olden times, and not so very long
ago either, everybody knew something about weaving,
at least every girl and woman knew something of
the art, and a loom was as familiar an object in the
household then as a sewing machine is now.</p>

  FIG. 3.&mdash;PRIMITIVE BASKET MAKING.
</div>

<p>The earliest practical weaver on record is the spider
and it may be that man learned his first lesson in
weaving from this skilled
little workman <span class="locked">(Fig.
1);</span> or the beautiful
nest of the weaver-bird
may have given to human
beings the first
hints in the weaving
art. Whoever may
have been his teacher,
it is certain that man
learned how to weave
in the earliest stages of
existence. It is thought
that his first effort in this direction consisted in
making cages for animals and wiers (traps) for
catching fish <span class="locked">(Fig. 2)</span> by interlacing vines or canes
or slender boughs. The next step was taken when
women began to make baskets and cradles and mats
by interlacing long slender strips of wood <span class="locked">(Fig. 3).</span></p>

<p>Basket weaving led to cloth weaving, and this
led to the loom. In <span class="locked">Figure 4</span> we see the simplest
and oldest form of the loom. It consisted of a single
stick (yarn beam) of wood about four feet long.
This was the first form of the loom&mdash;just a straight
stick of wood and nothing more. From the stick the
threads which run lengthwise in the cloth were suspended.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>These threads are known as the <i>warp</i>.
The threads which run breadthwise in the cloth are
known as the <i>weft</i>, or <i>woof</i>. As the woman's deft
fingers pass along with the weft she carries the thread
over the first warp thread, under the second, over
the third, under the fourth, and so on. Here we
have not only the simplest form of the loom but the
simplest kind of cloth.</p>

  FIG. 6.&mdash;THE HEDDLE.
</div>

<p>In the loom worked by the Pueblo woman <span class="locked">(Fig. 5)</span>
a new piece appears. This is the frame through
which the threads of the warp pass and which the
woman is holding in her right hand. The frame
is called a heald, or <i>heddle</i> <span class="locked">(Fig. 6).</span> The heddle is
of the greatest importance in the construction of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
loom and it is well worth while to understand what
it does. In the loom operated by the Chilcoot woman
<span class="locked">(Fig. 4)</span> you noticed that the weaver passed the weft
thread above and below the alternate threads of the
warp. This required a separate movement for every
thread of the warp; if there were a hundred threads
a hundred movements were required to pass the weft
across once. Now the heddle used by the Pueblo
woman separated the fifty warp threads that were
to pass above the weft thread from the fifty that
were to pass below it, making an opening called, a
<i>shed</i>. When the shed was made the weft thread
could be passed across at one movement. One movement
instead of a hundred! How was this accomplished?
Fifty alternate warp threads were passed
through the holes in the bars of the heddle
frame, one thread through each hole; the other
fifty alternate threads passed between the bars<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
of the heddle frame. Now suppose the entire
warp of a hundred threads is stretched tight and
firm between the woman's body and the yarn
beam. With her right hand she <i>raises</i> the heddle
and thus lifts the fifty threads which pass through the
holes in the bars, while the other fifty threads remain
unmoved. This movement makes the passage or
shed through which she passes the weft with the left
hand. After beating the weft thread close to the
cloth either with the fingers or with a sword-like
stick, she lowers the heddle with its fifty threads, the
other fifty still remain fixed and unmoved. Another
shed is formed and the weft is passed through again.
Thus with the raising and lowering of the heddle the
weft is passed backward and forward and the weav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>ing
goes on quite rapidly. If you care to do so you
can make a Pueblo loom and can weave a belt on it.</p>

  FIG. 7.&mdash;AN OLD AFRICAN LOOM.
</div>

<p>In the old African loom represented in Fig. 7 we
find several improvements
upon
the loom of the
Pueblo woman. In
the first place, it has
two heddles instead
of one. These are
operated by the feet,
leaving the hands
free to do other
work. In the second
place, the wooden
frame which the
weaver holds in his
right hand is not
to be seen in the
Pueblo loom. This
frame called the <i>batten</i>, or <i>lathe</i>, contains the <i>reed</i>,
which is a series of slats or bars between which
the threads of the warp pass after they leave the
heddle. When the weaver has thrown the weft
through the shed he brings the batten down hard and
the reed drives the last weft thread close to the
woven part of the cloth. The reed takes the place
of the sword-like stick used by the Pueblo woman.
Last and most important: in the African's left hand
is the <i>shuttle</i>, or little car&mdash;weaver's ship, the Ger<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>mans
call it&mdash;which carries the weft across

  FIG. 9.&mdash;A LOOM OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY.
</div>

<p>The loom described above seems to be clumsy and
rude when compared with a loom of the present day,
yet it is really the kind of loom which was used by
nearly all civilized people from the dawn of their civilization
to the middle of the eighteenth century. It
is the loom of history and poetry and song. Upon a
loom of this kind was woven Joseph's coat with its
many colors and the garment which the fair Penelope
made when she deceived her suitors. Of course as
the centuries passed the parts of the loom were better
made and weavers became more skilful. In <span class="locked">Figure 9</span>
we have the loom as it appeared in the sixteenth century.
If we inspect it closely we shall find it to be
merely the old African loom mounted on stout upright
timbers instead of being mounted on a tripod
made of poles. With her feet the weaver works the
heddle, with her right hand she throws the shuttle,
with her left she draws toward her the swinging
batten and drives the weft home with the reed.</p>

  FIG. 10.&mdash;KAY'S FLYING SHUTTLE.
</div>

<p>The year 1733 is a most important date in the
development of the loom for in that year John Kay,
a practical loommaker of Lancashire, England, invented
the flying shuttle and thus did more for the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
loom than any man whom we can distinguish by
name. To appreciate the great service of Kay we
must recall how the shuttle was operated before his
time. You remember it was thrown through the
shed by one of the weaver's hands and caught and
returned by the other hand. Sometimes it was
caught and returned by a boy. This was at best a
slow process and unless the weaver had an assistant<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
to return the shuttle only narrow pieces could be
woven. The common width of cloth, three-fourths
of a yard, had its origin in necessity. The weaver's
arms were not long enough to weave a wider
piece. "The essence of Kay's invention was that
the shuttle was thrown from side to side by a mechanical
device instead of being passed from hand
to hand. One hand only was required for the shuttle
while the other was left free to beat up the cloth
(with the batten) after each throw, and the shuttle
would fly across wide cloth as well as narrow."
You will be able to understand Kay's invention by
studying <span class="locked">Figure 10</span> which shows how the flying shuttle
worked. <i>G</i> is a groove (shuttle-race) on which the
shuttle runs as it crosses through the shed leaving
its thread behind it. <i>I</i> and <i>I</i> are boxes which the
shuttle <span class="locked">(Fig. 11)</span> enters at the end of the journey.
In each box is a driver <i>K</i> sliding freely on the
polished rod <i>F</i>. The weaver with his right hand<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
pulls the handle <i>H</i> and <i>K</i> drives the shuttle to the
opposite side. With his left hand he works the
reed, with his feet he works the heddle.</p>

  FIG. 11.&mdash;A MODERN SHUTTLE.
</div>

<p>The profits of Kay's invention were stolen, his
house was destroyed by a mob and he himself was
driven to a foreign country where he died in poverty.
Yet he deserves high rank among the benefactors
of mankind, for the flying shuttle doubled the power
of the loom and improved the quality of the cloth
woven. Kay's invention was the first step in a great
industrial revolution. The increased power of the
loom called for more yarn than the old spinning
wheel could supply. Hargreaves and Arkwright set
their wits to work and made their wonderful spinning
machine, and the demands of the loom were
supplied. So great was the supply of yarn that the
hand loom was behind with its work. Then in order
to keep up with the spinning machine the <i>power-loom</i>
was invented. Heddle and batten and shuttle
were now driven by a force of nature and all the
weaver had to do was to keep the shuttle filled with
thread and see that his loom worked properly. At
first the water-wheel was used to drive the power-loom
but later the steam-engine was made to do this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
work. All this was changing the face of the civilized
world. Hitherto weavers and spinners had
worked for themselves in their homes or in their own
shops; now they were gathered in large factories
where they worked as wage earners for an employer.
Hitherto industry had been carried on in small villages;
the great factories drew the people to large
industrial centers and the era of crowded cities began.</p>

  FIG. 12.&mdash;THE JACQUARD LOOM.
</div>

<p>Following the invention of the power-loom in the
latter half of the eighteenth century came the invention
of Joseph Jacquard of Lyons, France. This
very ingenious man in 1801 invented a substitute for
the heddle. We cannot readily understand the
workings of Jacquard's wonderful "attachment," as
his substitute for the heddle is called, but we ought
to know what the great Frenchman did for the loom.
In <span class="locked">Figure 12</span> you see that the cloth which is exposed
shows that beautiful designs have been woven
into it. This is what Jacquard did for the loom.
He made it weave into the cloth whatever design,
color or tint one might desire. He made the loom
a mechanical artist rivaling in excellence the work of a
human artist. The Jacquard loom has brought
about a revolution in man's, and especially in woman's
dress. With the old loom, colors and designs could
be woven into cloth but only very slowly, and goods
with fancy patterns were made at a cost that was
so great that only the rich could afford to buy. In
the olden times, therefore, almost everybody wore
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>plain clothes. With Jacquard's attachment the most
beautiful figures can be cheaply woven into the commonest
fabrics. As far as weaving is concerned, it
costs no more to have beautiful figures in cotton
goods than it does to have them in silk. As a result
the poor as well as the rich can dress as their
taste and fancy may suggest.</p>

<p>The last century brought improvements in the
weaving art as every century before it brought improvements,
but the changes made since Jacquard's
time need not concern us. The story of the loom
ends with the Jacquard "attachment." Perhaps no
other of man's inventions has a more interesting development
than the loom. We can see it grow, piece
by piece. First a simple stick from which dangle the
threads of the warp; then the heddle, then the shuttle,
then the reed, then the shuttle-race and the
swiftly flying shuttle, and last the Frenchman's wonderful
device for weaving in colors and fancy figures.</p>

a home as by instinct. The kind of house
erected by a people in the beginning depended upon
the surroundings, upon the enemies that prowled
about, upon the climate, upon the building materials
close at hand. In a hilly, rocky region primitive
folk built one kind of house, in a forest they built
another kind, in a low marshy district they built still
another kind. In all cases they took the materials
that were the easiest to get and erected the kind of

  FIG. 1.&mdash;BUILDING A HOUSE WITH WOOD.
</div>

<p>If one could have traveled over the earth during
the first days of man's history one would doubtless
have found that dwellings were made of wood, for
in those days the greater part of the earth was covered
with forests. To build a home in the forest
was the simplest of tasks. All that was necessary
was to fasten together the tops of several saplings,
interlace the saplings with boughs <span class="locked">(Fig. 1)</span> and
cover the frame with skins of animals or thatch it
with leaves and grass. A cone-shaped structure of
this pattern, a tent, or hut, or wigwam, was the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>house of all primitive people who lived where there
was plenty of wood.</p>

<p>In many regions, especially in parts of northwestern
Europe, the wigwam or hut was not always the
most suitable dwelling place for early man. In
hilly and mountainous districts and along streams
where shores were overhung by rocks or pierced by
caverns the first inhabitants found that a hollow in
the earth was the best kind of house. Sometimes
the house of the cave-dwellers was made by Nature
<span class="locked">(Fig. 2);</span> sometimes it was an artificial living-place
dug in the side of a hill or mountain. The cave was
truly a rude and gloomy home, yet there was a time
when large numbers of the human race lived in caves.
The Zuni Indians of Arizona in seeking a refuge
from their enemies built their homes far up in steep<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
cliffs where it was almost impossible for a stranger

<p>Coming down from the highlands to the lowlands
where there were swamps and marshes or where inland
lakes were numerous, we find that the first
houses were built upon piles driven in the water or
in the mud
<span class="locked">(Fig. 3).</span>
These lake-dwellings,
as
houses of this
kind were called,
were generally
connected
with the mainland
by gangways
of wooden piers, although sometimes they
could be approached only by boat. In the floors
of some of these curious dwellings were trapdoors
through which baskets could be lowered
for catching fish in the lake below. The children
of the lake-dwellers were tethered by the
feet to keep them from falling into the water.
The beautiful city of Venice in its infancy was a
community of lake-dwellers. The rough canoe
of the lake-dwelling time has developed into the
graceful gondola, and the rude wooden pier has
grown to be the magnificent Rialto.</p>

<p>In many regions the most convenient building
material is stone and all over the earth there are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
proofs to show that building with stone began at
a very early date. The stones in the earliest stone
structures were rough and unhewn and were laid
without mortar or cement <span class="locked">(Fig. 4)</span> yet they were
sometimes fitted together with such nicety that a thin
knife blade could not be passed between them. Remains
of stone houses built many thousands of years
ago may be seen in Peru, Mexico, Italy, and Greece.
These primitive dwellings were humble and simple,
but they were made of good material and they were
well built. They have weathered the storms of
ages and they have remained standing while later
and more pretentious buildings have crumbled and
disappeared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
The illustrations of early building which have
been given will make plain the truth that the people
of a particular country have taken the materials
nearest at hand and have constructed their homes
according to their particular needs. Now since the
beginnings of house building have been different in
different parts of the earth, the story of the house
will not be the same in all countries. In China and
Japan, where the light bamboo has always flourished
and has always been used in building, the house has
had one development; in countries where granite
and marble and heavy timber abound it has had another
and an entirely different development. What
then is the story of the house as we see it in our
country? Can this story be told? As one passes
through an American city looking at the public buildings
and churches and stores and dwellings can one
go back to the beginning and trace step by step the
growth of the house and tell how these came to be
what they are? Let us see if this cannot be done.</p>

  PALACE.
</div>

<p>Our story takes us back many thousands of years
to Egypt, the cradle of civilization. From Egypt
it will take us to Greece, thence to Rome, thence to
the countries of Northern Europe, thence to America.
What kind of houses did the Egyptians first
build? They built as simple a structure as can be
imagined; they erected four walls and over these
they placed a flat roof <span class="locked">(Fig. 5).</span> The roof was
made flat because in Egypt there is scarcely any
rain and there was no need for a roof with a slant.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>In all those countries where rain seldom falls, or
never falls, the flat roof is the natural roof <span class="locked">(Fig. 6).</span>
Although their buildings were simple in construction
the Egyptians left behind them most remarkable
specimens of the builder's art. Their pyra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>mids
and monuments and sphinxes and palaces have
always been foremost among the great wonders of
the world. <span class="locked">Figure 7</span> shows the interior of an
ancient Egyptian palace. This palace had only an
awning for a roof. That was all that was necessary
to keep out the rays of the sun. Notice the
lofty pillars or columns of this building. You see
they are adorned above or below with the figure of
the lotus, the national flower of the Egyptians.
The column, as we shall see, plays an important part

  FIG. 8.&mdash;A GREEK DWELLING.
</div>

<p>From Egypt we pass over "the sea" to Greece.
The Greeks borrowed ideas wherever they could
and in the matter of architecture they borrowed
heavily from Egypt. But they did not borrow the
flat roof of the Egyptians. In Greece there was
some rainfall and this fact had to be taken into account
when building a house; the roof had to slant
so that the rain could run off. Now the Greeks
taught the world the best way to make a slanting
roof. They made the roof to slant in two directions
from a central ridge <span class="locked">(Fig. 8)</span> instead of having
the entire roof to slant in one direction like an
ugly shed. The slant was gentle because there was
no snow to be carried off. The roof of two slants
formed a gable. The Greeks, then, were the inventors
of the <i>gable</i>. The column they borrowed
from Egypt. But whenever the Greeks borrowed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
an invention or an idea they nearly always improved
upon it. Instead of slavishly imitating the
Egyptian columns they tried to make better ones
and they were so successful that they soon became
the teachers of the world in column making.</p>

  FIG. 9.&mdash;THE THREE ORDERS OF COLUMNS.
</div>

<p>The oldest and strongest of the Greek columns
belong to what is known as the Doric order <span class="locked">(Fig.
9),</span> a name given to them because they were first
made by the Dorians, the original Greek dwellers
in Europe. Aside from the flutes or channels which
ran throughout its length the Doric column was
perfectly plain. In the older Doric columns even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
the flutes are absent. Its <i>capital</i> or top, was without
ornament. Later the graceful and elegant
Ionic pillar <span class="locked">(Fig. 9)</span> came into fashion. We can
always distinguish an Ionic column by the volute or
scroll at its capital. The latest of the Greek
columns was the Corinthian <span class="locked">(Fig. 9),</span> the lightest,
the most slender and the most richly decorated of
all. A cluster of acanthus leaves at its capital is
the most prominent ornament of the Corinthian
column. The Greeks carried the art of column
making to such perfection that even to this day we
imitate their patterns. A column in a modern
building is almost certain to be a Greek column. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
is worth one's while, therefore, to be able to tell
one Greek column from another. One can do this
by remembering (1) that the Doric column is perfectly
plain and has no capital; (2) that the Ionic
column has a scroll at the capital; (3) that the
capital of the Corinthian column is adorned with a
cluster of acanthus leaves.</p>

  FIG. 11.&mdash;INTERIOR OF A ROMAN CLUB HOUSE.
</div>

<p>Our story now takes us to Italy. Greece fell before
the power of Rome 146 <span class="smallish smcap">B.C.</span>, but before she fell
she had taught her conquerors a great deal about
architecture. Indeed the Romans took up the art
of building where the Greeks left it. They needed
the Greek gable for they had rains, and the Greek
column recommended itself to them on account of
its beauty. They used the best features of Grecian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
architecture and added a feature that was largely
their own. This was the <i>arch</i>. The Greeks, like
the Egyptians before them, bridged over the openings
of doors and windows and the spaces between
columns by means of straight wooden beams or
long blocks of stone. The Romans bridged over
these spaces with the arch <span class="locked">(Fig. 10).</span> If you will
study the arch you will see that it is a curved structure
which is supported by its own curve. You will
also see that it is a structure of great strength. The
greater the weight placed upon it, providing its
bases are supported, the stronger it gets. In teaching
the world how to make arches Rome added to
the house an element of great strength and beauty.
With the arch came the tall building. In Greece a
house was never more than two stories high. In
Rome arch rose upon arch <span class="locked">(Fig. 11);</span> the dome
which is itself a kind of arch appeared and palaces
were piled story upon story until they seemed to
reach the skies.</p>

  FIG. 12.&mdash;A DWELLING IN NORTHERN EUROPE.
</div>

<p>From Italy we pass to northern Europe. The
power of Rome fell 476 <span class="smallish smcap">A.D.</span>, but before that date
the greater part of Europe had been Romanized,
and the Roman way of building with column and
arch and dome had been learned in France and Germany
and England. But the climate of those
countries was different from that of Italy and a
slight change in the Roman way of building was
necessary. In the northern countries there were
heavy rains and snows and a roof with a gentle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
slope was not suitable for carrying off large quantities
of water and snow. A gable <span class="locked">(Fig. 12)</span> with a
sharp slant was necessary. Hence throughout northern
Europe the roofs were built much steeper than
they were in Italy and Greece, although in other
respects the northern houses resembled more or less
closely those of the older southern countries.</p>

</div>

<p>The pointed roof which was made necessary by
the climate of the north prepared the way for a new
style of building, the <i>pointed</i> or <i>Gothic</i> style. This
style began to appear in the twelfth century and by
the end of the thirteenth century&mdash;that remarkable
century again&mdash;the buildings of all northern
Europe were Gothic. The new style began with a
change in the arch. The Roman arch was a semi-circle
and was therefore described from one center.
The Gothic arch was formed by describing it from
two centers instead of one and was therefore a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
pointed arch. As the pointed arch grew in favor
it became the fashion to shape other parts of the
building into points wherever it was possible to do
this. The rounding dome became a spire "pointing
heavenward"; the windows and doors were
pointed and so
were the ornaments
and decorations.
For
several centuries
buildings fairly
bristled with
points <span class="locked">(Fig.
13).</span> The finest
example of
Gothic architecture
is the glorious
cathedral at
Cologne.</p>

  FIG. 14.&mdash;A RENAISSANCE DWELLING.
</div>

<p>During the
thousand years
of the Dark
Ages (476-1453)
the
glories of the
civilization of
ancient Greece
and Rome faded
almost completely
from human<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
vision. Events of the sixteenth century brought
those glories again into view and Europe was
dazzled by them. Men everywhere became dissatisfied
with the things around them. They longed
for ancient things. They read ancient authors, they
imitated ancient artists, they imbibed the wisdom of
ancient teachers. This was the period of the Renaissance,
the time when the world was born anew&mdash;as
it pleased men to think and say. The world of
the present died and the old world of Greece and
Rome was brought to life. Of course in the new
order of things architecture underwent a change.
<i>It</i> was born again; <i>it</i> experienced a renaissance.
The pointed style grew less pleasing to the builder's
eye, and wherever he could he placed in his building
something that was Greek or Roman, here an
arched doorway, there a Greek column. There
resulted from these changes a style that was neither
Gothic, Grecian nor Roman, but a mixture of all
these. This mixed style was named after the
period in which it arose. When you see a building
that strongly resembles the buildings of ancient
Greece and Rome and at the same time has features
which belong to other styles you may safely say that
the building belongs to the renaissance style. <span class="locked">(Fig.
14.)</span> The most noble and beautiful examples of
renaissance architecture are the church of St. Peter's
at Rome and the church of St. Paul at London.</p>

  <div class="justify">The Cliveden Chew Mansion, where the Battle of Germantown

</div>

<p>We now pass over to America. About the time
the old world was born anew the new world was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
found. The houses of the first settlers in America
were of course rude and ugly but as the colonies
grew in population and wealth more expensive and
beautiful houses were built. As we should expect,
the colonists built their best houses in the style that
was then in fashion in the old world and that was
the renaissance style. They did not, however, copy
the old world architecture outright. They had dif<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>ferent
materials, a different climate and a different
class of workmen and they had to build according
to these changed conditions. The result was a style
of building that has been called colonial <span class="locked">(Fig. 15).</span>
Colonial architecture was simply American renaissance.
And that is what it is to-day. To say that
a house is in the colonial style is to say that it represents
a certain architect's ideas as to what is best and
most beautiful in all styles.</p>

<p>The story of the house really ends with the period
of the renaissance. Since the sixteenth century
nothing really new in architecture has been discovered
and men have been wedded to no particular
style. When we want to build a house we choose<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
from all the styles and build according to our tastes.
Our story of the house, however, will not be complete
without a brief account of what has been called <i>elevator</i>
architecture. The high price of land in large
cities makes it necessary to run buildings up to a considerable
height if they are to be profitable. Now if
a building is more than five stories high it must have
an elevator, or lift, and if an elevator is to be put
in, the building might as well be run up nine or ten
stories. American business men learned this thirty<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
or forty years ago and began to build high, and they
have been building higher and higher ever since.
There are tall buildings in other countries but the
"sky-scraper" of twenty-five and thirty stories is
found only in the United States <span class="locked">(Fig. 16).</span></p>

<p>Thus we may see in the house of to-day a long
and unbroken story. Where the roof is flat it is
Egyptian; where it slants gently in two directions
it is Greek; where it is steep or sharply pointed it is
Gothic. The columns are Greek, the rounded arches
are Roman. The whole is the result of the thousands
of years of effort which man has given to the
task of providing for himself a safe, convenient
and beautiful home.</p>

<p>Man's only carriage at first was of course his own
feet. When he wanted to go to any place he had to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
take "Walker's hack," if a playful expression may
be pardoned. As a traveler on foot, man soon surpassed
all other animals. He could walk down the
deer and wear out the horse. When it came to
carrying things from place to place, in the beginning
he had to rely upon his own limbs and muscles.
It was not long, however, before he learned that
there were good ways and bad ways of carrying
things, and he soon set about finding
the best way. We may believe that
he began by making a snug bundle
and carrying it on his shoulder.
Then he found that he could
carry a heavier burden upon
his back, and he invented a
pack or frame on which he
could carry things on his back
<span class="locked">(Fig. 1)</span> after the manner of
one of our modern pack
peddlers.</p>

<p>In the course of time man
tamed one or more of the wild
beasts which roamed near him.
Then the burden was
shifted from the back
of a man to the back
of a beast. The first
beast of burden in
South America was
the llama; in India it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
was the elephant; in
Arabia it was the camel
<span class="locked">(Fig. 2).</span> In Europe
and in parts of Asia and
in Egypt the horse first
became man's burden
bearer and the nations
which had the services
of this swift and strong
animal outstripped the
other nations of the
world. "Which is the
most useful of animals?"
asked one Egyptian god of another. "The
horse," was the reply, "because the horse enables a
man to overtake and slay his enemy."</p>

<p>It is often easier to drag a thing along than it is
to carry it. This fact led to the invention of what
we may call the first and simplest form of carriage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
This was the drag or travail (tra-vay´), a cart without
wheels <span class="locked">(Fig. 3).</span> Two long saplings were fastened
at the large end to the strap across the horse's
breast and the small end upon which the burden was
placed dragged upon the ground. Mr. Arthur
Mitchell in his delightful book, "The Past in the
Present," tells us that he saw carts of this kind in
actual use in the highlands of Scotland as late as
1864! An improvement upon the travail was the
sledge made of the forked limb of a tree <span class="locked">(Fig. 4).</span>

<p>In many cases it is easier to roll a thing than it is
to drag it. This fact led to another step in the
development of the carriage; it led from the cart
without wheels to a cart with a wheel&mdash;a most important
step in the history of inventions. The first
wheeled cart was simply a log from each end of
which projected an axle <span class="locked">(Fig. 5).</span> The axle fitted
in the holes of a frame upon which the body of the
cart was placed and to which the horse or the ox was
attached. As the cart moved along, wheel (log and
axle) turned together. The very ancient method
of moving a load by rolling it along was in use in
the United States not so very long ago. As late<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
as 1860 in some of the southern States hogsheads
of tobacco <span class="locked">(Fig. 6)</span> were rolled over country roads
in the manner just described and as late as 1880 the
fishermen of Nantucket used as a fish cart a vehicle
that had only a barrel for its wheel. <span class="locked">(Fig. 7.)</span>
The common wheel-barrow and the one-wheeled
carts which are still used in China and Japan had
their origin in the rolling log.</p>

<p>We are told by some writers that the rolling log

log and the axle was the middle portion of the log<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
hewn down to a proper
size <span class="locked">(Fig. 8).</span> Here
wheels and axle turned

modern car wheel. This
makes a very pretty
story but I am afraid
the solid two-wheeled
affair represented in
<span class="locked">Figure 8</span> is only imaginary, and that in a true
account of the development of the cart it has
no place. The true beginning of the two-wheeled
cart may be learned from <span class="locked">Figure 9.</span> Here the
wheels are two <i>very short</i> logs through the center
of which are holes in which the round ends (axles)
of a piece of timber (the axle-tree) fit. When the
cart moves, the wheels turn upon the axle. The one-<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>wheeled

<p>The first two-wheeled carts were a great improvement
upon the single rolling log, yet they were exceedingly
heavy and clumsy. The trouble was with
the wheel. This was very thick and with the exception
of the hole in which the axle went it was
entirely solid. Wheelwrights at a very early date
saw that the problem was to make the wheel light
and at the same time to keep it strong. Little by little
this problem was solved. At first crescent-shaped
holes were made in the wheel <span class="locked">(Fig. 10).</span>
This made the wheel lighter, but did not weaken it.
In its next form the wheel was even less solid than<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
before. It now consisted of four curved pieces of
wood <span class="locked">(Fig. 11)</span> held together by four spokes. In
this wheel there was a hub, but the spokes were not
inserted in it; they were fastened about it. In the
Egyptian chariot <span class="locked">(Fig. 12)</span> we find the wheel in the
last stage of its interesting and remarkable development.
Here the spokes, six in number, are inserted
in the hub from which they radiate to the six<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
pieces of the felly or inner rim. Around the felly
is the outer rim or tire made of wood and fastened
to the felly with thongs. The wheel of to-day has
more iron in it, and has more spokes and is lighter
and stronger than the old Egyptian wheel, yet in its
main features it is made like it.</p>

<p>A light running two-wheeled carriage was used
by all the civilized nations of the ancient world.
Three thousand years ago in the great and wicked
city of Nineveh chariots raced up and down the
paved streets "jostling against one another in the
broad ways, with the crack of the whip, the rattle of
the wheel and the prancing of horses." The
chariot played an important part in the life of the
Greeks and Romans, in their racing contests and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
their wars, and throughout the Middle Ages it was
the only vehicle in general use in Europe. As time
passed it was of course made lighter and stronger
and better. The doctor's gig so charmingly described
by Holmes in his "Wonderful One Hoss

  FIG. 15.&mdash;A COACH OF THE MIDDLE AGES.
</div>

<p>Bring the hind part of one Egyptian chariot opposite
to the hind part of another, lash the two
chariots together, remove the tongue of one of the
chariots and you have made a chariot of four wheels
or a <i>coach</i>. The form of the most ancient of four-wheeled
carriages leads to the belief that the coach
was first made by joining together two two-wheeled
chariots in the way just described. The ancient
Egyptians had their four-wheeled chariots but only
their gods and their kings had the privilege of riding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
in them. For centuries none but the great and the
powerful rode in coaches. The Roman chariot <span class="locked">(Fig.
14),</span> bad imitations of which we see nowadays in
circus processions, was used only in the splendid
triumphal processions which entered Rome after a
great victory. In the Middle Ages we get a glimpse
of a four-wheeled carriage now and then, but usually
the king or a queen is lounging in it <span class="locked">(Fig. 15).</span>
The coach could not be generally used in Europe
in medieval times because the roads were so bad.
The excellent roads made by the Romans had not
been kept in good condition. Traveling had to be
done either on horseback or in the two-wheeled carriage.
In 1550 there were but three coaches in
Paris and in London there was but one. In 1564,
however, we find Queen Elizabeth riding in a coach
<span class="locked">(Fig. 16)</span> on her way to see her lover, Lord
Leicester. Insert more spokes and lighter ones in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>

  FIG. 2.&mdash;CUGNOT'S STEAM CARRIAGE, 1769.
</div>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">I</span>n the last chapter the story of the Carriage was
brought up to the reign of Queen Elizabeth of
England. In the century following Elizabeth's
reign a new and most remarkable step in the development
of the carriage was taken. You remember
that in the seventeenth century there was a great deal
of experimenting with steam <span class="locked">(p. 58).</span> Among other
experiments was one made by Sir Isaac Newton.
This great philosopher tried in 1680 to make a
steam-carriage, or <i>locomotive</i>,
as we call it.
<span class="locked">Figure 1</span> shows the principle
upon which he
tried to make his carriage
work. The steam
was to react against the
air, as in the case of
Hero's engine (p. 56)
and thus push the carriage along. Newton's experiment
was not satisfactory but the idea of a steam-carriage
was now in men's heads and the hope of making
one continued to be cherished. In 1769 Cugnot, a<span class="pagenum pfirst"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
French army officer, invented a steam-carriage of
three wheels <span class="locked">(Fig. 2)</span> but it was a very poor one.
It traveled only three or four miles an
hour, it could carry but three persons, and it had
to stop every ten minutes to get up steam. Cugnot,
however, deserves to be ranked among the great inventors
for he showed that a steam-engine could be
attached to a carriage and could push it along. In
other words he showed that steam could be used for
transportation as well as for working pumps and
turning the wheels of factories. And that was just
what was needed most in the latter part of the eighteenth
century. Man needed assistance in traveling;
he especially needed help in carrying things from<span class="pagenum pfirst"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span>
place to place. The steam-engine was keeping the
mines dry and making it possible to mine great
quantities of coal and was turning the wheels of
great factories where the spinning-jenny and the
new power loom <span class="locked">(p. 119)</span> were consuming enormous
quantities of cotton and wool. Now if the
steam-engine could also be made to carry the coal
and cotton and wool to the factory, and the manufactured
products from the factory to the market,
the industrial revolution would be complete indeed.</p>

<p>Inventors everywhere put their wits together to
construct an engine that would draw a load. The
great Watt tried to make one, but having failed, he
came to the conclusion that the steam-engine could
do good work only when standing still. Among
those who entered the contest was Richard Trevithick,
a Cornish miner, born in 1771. Trevithick
when a lad at school was able to work six examples
in arithmetic while his teacher worked one. He
proved to be as quick in mechanics as he was in
mathematics. He began his experiments with
steam when a mere boy, and as early as 1796 he
had built a steam-locomotive which would run on
a table. By 1801 he had constructed a steam-carriage
<span class="locked">(Fig. 7).</span> Three years later (1804) Trevithick
exhibited a locomotive which carried ten tons
of iron, seventy men, and five wagons a distance of
nine and one-half miles at the rate of five miles an
hour. This was the first steam carriage that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
actually performed useful work. The honor of inventing
the first successful locomotive, therefore, belongs
to Richard Trevithick, although he never received
the honor that was due him.</p>

<p>The honor went to George Stephenson, of Wylam,
near Newcastle, England. Stephenson's parents
were so poor that they could not afford to send him
to school long enough for him to learn to read and
write. In his eighteenth year, however, he attended
a night school and learned something of the common
branches. In his childhood Stephenson lived among
steam-engines. He began as an engine boy in a colliery
and was soon promoted to the position of fireman.
At an early age he was trying to build the
locomotive that the world needed so badly, one that
would do good work at a small cost. Trevithick's
locomotive was too expensive. Stephenson wanted
a locomotive that would pay its owner a profit. At
the age of thirty-three he had solved his problem.
In 1814 he exhibited a locomotive that would run
ten or twelve miles an hour and carry passengers
and freight cheaper than horses could carry them.
Eleven years later he was operating a railroad between
Stockton and Darlington, England. The
steam carriage was now a success <span class="locked">(Fig. 3).</span> The
iron horse was soon transporting passengers and
freight in all the civilized countries of the world
<span class="locked">(Fig. 4).</span> Observe that the first passenger car was
simply the old coach joined to a locomotive.</p>

<p>The locomotive worked wonders in travel and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
carrying loads, yet men were not satisfied with it.
We never are satisfied with our means of transportation.
No matter how comfortably or cheaply or
fast we may travel we always want something better.
In the latter part of the nineteenth century the great
cities of the world were becoming over-crowded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
The people could not be carried from one part of a
city to another without great discomfort. The
street cars drawn by horses could not carry the
crowds and
the elevated
steam cars
were not satisfactory.
Wits
were set to
work to relieve
the situation
and about thirty years ago the <i>electric car</i> <span class="locked">(Fig. 5)</span>
was invented. Without horse or locomotive this
quick-moving car not only successfully handles
the crowds which move about the city but it also
relieves over-crowding by enabling thousands to reach
conveniently and cheaply their suburban homes. It
also does the work of the steam car and carries passengers
long distances
from city to city.</p>

<p>A late development
in carriage making is
seen in the automobile.
As far back as the sixteenth
century a horseless
carriage was invented
<span class="locked">(Fig. 6)</span> and was
operated on the streets of a German city. But
here the power was furnished by human muscle.
The first real automobile <span class="locked">(Fig. 7)</span> was invented in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
1801, by the man who invented the first successful
locomotive. Trevithick's road locomotive&mdash;for
that is what an automobile really is&mdash;did not work
well because the roads upon which he tried it were
in very bad condition. Inventors after Trevithick
for a long time paid but little attention to the road
locomotive; they bestowed their best thought upon
the locomotive that was to be run upon rails&mdash;the
railroad locomotive. In recent years, however, they
have been working on the so-called automobile and
they have already given us a horseless carriage that
can run on a railless road at a rate as great as that
of the fastest railroad locomotives. To what extent
is this newest of carriages likely to be used? It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
is already driving out the horse. Will it also
drive out the electric car and the railroad locomotive?
Are we coming to the time when the railroad
will be no more and when all travel and all
hauling of freight will be done by carriages and
wagons without horses on roads without rails? The
answers to these questions can of course only be
guessed.</p>

  YEARS AGO.</div>
</div>

<p>The last and latest form of the carriage is seen in
the <i>flying-machine</i>, the automobile of the air. In all
ages men have watched with envy the movements of
birds and have dreamed of flying-machines, but only
in modern times has man dared to take wings and
glide in bird-like fashion through the air. The first
actual flying by a human being was done by a Frenchman
named Bresnier, who, in 1675, constructed a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
machine similar to that shown in the right hand picture
at the top of <span class="locked">Figure 9.</span> Bresnier worked his
wings with his feet and hands. Once he jumped
from a second story window and flew over the roof
of a cottage. From the days of Bresnier on to the
present time man has taxed his wits to the utmost
to conquer the air, and in his efforts to do this he
has invented almost every conceivable kind of machine.
About the middle of the nineteenth century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
inventors began to apply steam to the flying-machine,
and it is said that in 1842 a man named Philips was
able, by the aid of revolving fans driven by steam,
to elevate a machine to a considerable distance and
fly across two fields. In 1896 Professor Langley,
with a flying-machine driven by a small steam-engine,
made three flights of about three-fourths of a mile
each over the Potomac River, near Washington.
This was the first time a flying-machine was propelled
a long distance by its own power; it was the first
aerial automobile. But the aerial steam carriage
was never a success; the steam engine was too heavy.
In the early years of the twentieth century inventors
began to use the light gasoline engine to drive their
flying-machines and then real progress in the art of
flying began, and so great has been that progress
that the automobiles of the air are becoming rivals
of those on the land.</p>

  FIG. 2.&mdash;THE INVENTION OF THE CANOE.
</div>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">A</span>t first, when a man wanted to cross a deep
stream, he was compelled to swim across. But
man at his best is a poor swimmer, and it was not
long before he invented a better method of traveling
on water. A log drifting in a stream furnished the
hint. By resting his body upon the log and plashing
with his hands and feet he found he could move
along faster and easier. Thus the log was the first
boat and the human arm was the first oar. Experience
soon taught our primitive boatman to get on
top of the log and paddle along, using the limb of
a tree for an oar
<span class="locked">(Fig. 1).</span> But the
round log would
turn with the least
provocation and its
passenger suffered
many unceremonious
duckings. So
the boatman made
his log flat on top.
It now floated better and did not turn over so easily.
Then the log was made hollow, either by burning
<span class="locked">(Fig. 2),</span> or by means of a cutting instrument. Thus
<span class="pagenum pfirst"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>the canoe was invented. Very often if the nature of
the tree permitted it, the log was stripped of its bark,
and this bark was used as a canoe.</p>

  FIG. 4.&mdash;A PRIMITIVE OARLOCK.
</div>

<p>The canoe was one of the earliest of boats, but
it is not in line with the later growth. The ancestry
of the modern boat begins with the log and is traced
through the raft rather than through the canoe.
By lashing together several logs it was found that
larger burdens could be carried. Therefore the boat
of a single log grew into one of several logs&mdash;a
raft <span class="locked">(Fig. 3).</span> By the time man had learned to
make a raft he had learned something else:
he had learned to row his boat along by
pulling at an oar instead of pushing it along with a
paddle. But in order to
row there must be something
against which the
oar may rest; so the oarlock
<span class="locked">(Fig. 4)</span> was invented.
Rafts were used by
nearly all the nations of
antiquity. Herodotus, the
father of history, tells us
that they were in use in
ancient Chaldea. In <span class="locked">Figure 3</span> we have a kind of
raft that may still be seen on some of the rivers of
South America. Here a most important step in
boat-building has been taken. A <i>sail</i> has been
hoisted and one of the forces of nature has been bidden
to assist man in moving his boat along.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>The raft was bound to develop into the large
boat. The central log was used as a keel and about
this was built a boat of the desired shape and size.
Stout timbers, called ribs, slanted from the keel, and
on the ribs were fastened planks running lengthwise
with the vessel. To keep out the water the seams
between the planks were filled with pitch or wax.
Thus the raft grew into a large spoon-shaped vessel
<span class="locked">(Fig. 5).</span> The early boat was usually propelled
by oars, although a single sail sometimes invoked
the assistance of the wind. It had no rudder and
no deck, and if there was an anchor it was only a
heavy stone.</p>

<p>In the early history of the boat there was no such
thing as a rudder. The oarsman had to steer his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
craft as best he could. With the appearance of
larger boats, however, a steersman comes into view.
He steers by means of a paddle held over the stern
of the boat. Within historic times, probably about
the time of Homer (1100
<span class="smallish smcap locked">B.&nbsp;C.</span>), the rudder appears
as an oar with a broad blade
protruding through a hole
in the side of the boat well
to the stern <span class="locked">(Fig. 6).</span>
Throughout the whole
period of ancient history
boats were steered by rudders
of this kind.</p>

<p>The anchor came later
than the rudder. Of course
even in primitive times
there were methods of securing the vessel to the
ground under water but they were very crude. Sometimes
a sack of sand was used as an anchor, sometimes
a log of wood covered with lead was thrown
overboard to hold the boat
in its place. In Homer's
time the anchor was a bent
rod with a single fluke.
About 600 <span class="smallish smcap locked">B.&nbsp;C.</span> Anacharsis,
one of the seven wise men of Greece, gave a
practical turn to his wisdom and invented an anchor
with two flukes <span class="locked">(Fig. 7).</span> The invention re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>ceived

  FIG. 9.&mdash;A ROMAN GALLEY WITH THREE BANKS OF OARS.
</div>

<p>It was in the Mediterranean Sea that the boat had
its most rapid development. As early as we can
get a glimpse of that wonderful body of water it was
alive with boats (called galleys) that had well-laid
keels and lofty sides, and rudders, and sails. The
greatest of the earlier navigators were the Ph&oelig;nicians
whose boats had traversed 5,000 years ago the
whole course of the Mediterranean and had even
ventured beyond the Straits of Gibraltar. The ancient
Greeks also were a great sea-going people, and
their merchantmen or trading boats visited every part
of the known world. But it was the Romans who
at last became masters of the ancient seas. The
Roman galley, therefore, may be taken as the representative
boat of ancient times. What kind of a boat
was the Roman galley? It was propelled chiefly by
oars, just as nearly all the boats of antiquity were.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
Occasionally a sail was hoisted when the wind was
favorable but the main reliance was the rower's arm.
Men had not yet learned to use the sail to the best
advantage. The older galleys had one row of oarsmen
<span class="locked">(Fig. 8),</span> but as the struggle for the mastery
of the sea became keener the boats were made larger
and more rowers were necessary. Galleys with two
and three, and even four rows of oarsmen were built
by the Roman navy. When there was more than
one row of oars the rowers sat on benches one
above another. The oarsmen were slaves or prisoners
captured in war, and their life was most
<span class="locked">wretched.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">18</a></span> They were chained to the benches on
which they sat, and were compelled to row as long as
a spark of life was left. Sometimes they dipped their
oars to the music of the flute, but more often it
was to the crack of the lash. <span class="locked">Figure 9</span> shows us how
the Roman galley looked when Rome was at the
height of her power (100 <span class="smallish smcap locked">A.&nbsp;D.</span>). Here is a vessel
about 400 feet long and about 50 feet across its
<i>deck</i>, a part of the boat, by the by, which was not
to be seen in the earlier galleys. The boat is a trireme,
that is, it has openings for three tiers of oars,
and it is propelled by several hundred oarsmen. For
steering purposes it has four stout paddles, two on
each side near the stern. Two masts instead of one
carry the sail which, considering the size of the boat,
would seem to be insufficient. This galley of the first
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>century of our era represents the full development of
the boat in ancient times.</p>

</div>

<p>After the downfall of Rome (476 <span class="smallish smcap locked">A.&nbsp;D.</span>) it was a
long time before there was any real progress in boat-making.
The glimpses we get now and then of vessels
in the Middle Ages almost make us feel that
boat-building was going backward rather than forward.
But such was not the case. The ship in
which William of Normandy sailed <span class="locked">(Fig. 10)</span> when
he crossed over the Channel to give battle to Harold
(1066 <span class="smallish smcap locked">A.&nbsp;D.</span>) was not so impressive as a Roman
galley, yet it was, nevertheless, a better boat. In the
first place William's boat was a better sailer; it relied
more upon the force of the wind and less upon the
oar. In the second place, it could be steered better,
for the rudder had found its way to its proper place
and was worked by a tiller. Finally, the shape of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
the Norman boat fitted it for fiercer battles with the
waves.</p>

had undergone
the same changes.

more sails. Instead
of three rows of
oars and two sails
as on the Roman
galley, there are
three sails and one
row of oars. This
was the tendency of
the boat-builder in
the Middle Ages;
he crowded on the
sail and took off the
rowers. A war-boat

century <span class="locked">(Fig. 12)</span> shows that

</div>

<p>About the middle of the
thirteenth century there began
to appear on the decks
of vessels almost everywhere
in Europe, a little instrument
that is of the greatest importance
in the history of the
boat. This was the <i>mariner's
compass</i>. The use of the
magnetic needle was known
in China <span class="locked">(Fig. 13)</span> a thousand
years before it was
known to the Europeans, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
in this, as in many other instances, the Chinese did not
profit by their knowledge. Sailors have always sailed
at night by the North star; but before the use of the
compass was understood they could little more than
guess their way when the night was dark and the stars
could not be seen. With a mariner's needle on board
they can tell the direction they are going no matter
how dark the night. We can easily understand that
sailors prized very highly the discovery of the compass.
With the appearance of this faithful guide
they became bolder and bolder and were soon venturing
out upon the trackless expanse of the ocean.
It was the compass that led to the discovery of the
new world, for without it no sailor could have held
his course due west long enough to reach the American
coast.</p>

<p>After men had learned to carry their burdens on
the broad back of the ocean, boat-building took
on new life. All the great nations of Europe wanted
a share in the new world that had just been found;
but no nation could hope to profit greatly by the discovery
of Columbus if its vessels were not swift and
strong. So there arose a grim contest for the mastery
of the Atlantic, just as in ancient times there had been
a struggle for the mastery of the Mediterranean.
Spain, France, Portugal, Holland and England all
joined in the battle. When we see the kind of boats
she sent out upon the oceans we are not surprised that
England won. Compare the heavy, angular galley of
the first century with the graceful ship of the sixteenth<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
century and we see at once the progress the boat
made in the Middle Ages <span class="locked">(Fig. 14).</span></p>

</div>

<p>The log, the raft, the galley, the sailing-ship, these
were the steps in the development of the boat up to
the end of the seventeenth century. In the eighteenth
century another step was taken. You remember
that in that century inventors were everywhere
trying to make a steam carriage. They were
at the same time trying to make a steam boat. Their
efforts to use steam to drive boats were rewarded with
success earlier than were their efforts to use it to draw
carriages. This was to be expected. Boat-building
has always moved along faster than carriage-building.
Men were gliding about in well-built canoes
before they had even the clumsiest of carts. The
Londoners who gazed with admiration upon the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>

seen as much as a lumbering coach. And so with
the steamboat; it had crossed the Atlantic before the
locomotive could carry passengers from one town to
the next.</p>

  FIG. 15.&mdash;THE MARQUIS OF JOUFFROY'S STEAMBOAT, 1783.
</div>

<p>France, England, Germany and America were all
eager to have the first steamboat. In this race
America won, although France and England came out
with their colors flying. As far back as 1663 the
Marquis of Worcester, of whom we have heard
before (p. 59), described a vessel that could be
moved by steam: "It roweth," he said, "it draweth,
it driveth (if needs be) to pass London bridge
against the stream at low water." It was one thing,
however, to describe a steamboat, and quite another
thing to make one. Worcester's steam-vessel existed
only in the imagination of the inventor. Denys
Papin, who did so much for the steam-engine, fitted
out a boat with revolving paddles which were turned
by horses. This was nothing new. The ancient
Roman galley was sometimes propelled by paddle-wheels
turned by horses or oxen. It is sometimes
claimed that Papin turned the paddle-wheels of
his boat by means of steam, but there are no grounds
for the claim. If France wants the honor of having
made the first steamboat she would do better to
turn from Papin and look to Marquis of Jouffroy of
Lyons, This nobleman, it is claimed, built a steamboat
<span class="locked">(Fig. 15)</span> which made a successful trip on the
river Soane, in the year 1783, before a multitude of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
witnesses. This claim may or may not be just. It
may be as the French say: the boat after the trial
trip may have been taken to pieces, the model may
have been lost and the French Revolution may have
swallowed up those who witnessed the trip.</p>

<p>About the time the Frenchman is said to have
been experimenting with his steamboat on the
Soane similar experiments were being tried in many
other places. In the latter part of the eighteenth
century the idea of a steam-propelled boat seemed to
be in the air. An English poet of the time was bold
enough to prophesy:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span></p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
Soon shall thy arm, Unconquered Steam, afar<br />
Drag the slow barge and draw the rapid car,<br />
Or on wide, waving wings, expanded bear<br />
The flying chariot through the fields of air.<br />
</div></div>

<p>For the most part the prophesy has been fulfilled,
although the steam flying-machine is not yet an accomplished
fact. Among those who helped to make
good the words of the poet was James Rumsey, of
Sheppardtown, Virginia. Rumsey in 1786 propelled,
by means of steam, a boat on the Potomac River
moving at the rate of five miles an hour. It is almost
certain that this was the first boat ever drawn by
steam. How did Rumsey drive his boat? A piston
in a cylinder was worked by a steam-engine. When
the piston was raised it brought water in and when it
was pushed down it forced the water out behind and
the reaction of the jet pushed the boat along. A
remarkable revival of a very ancient idea! Just as
Hero turned his globe by reaction, just as Newton
pushed the first steam carriage along by reaction, so
Rumsey pushed the first steamboat along by reaction.</p>

<p>If you will look on a map of the United States and
observe the vast network of waterways which come
to the different parts of the country you will understand
how important a subject steam navigation must
have been to the people of America in the latter part
of the eighteenth century. Here was a tract of land
containing millions upon millions of fertile acres, but
it lacked good roads, and without roads it could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
be developed. It was, however, traversed by thousands
of miles of excellent water-roads and it was
plain that if steamboats could be put upon these rivers
the gain would be incalculable. The most pressing
need of the time, therefore, was a steamboat.
No one saw this more clearly than John Fitch. This
talented but eccentric man served his country in the
Revolution, and after the war was over roamed
hither and thither for several years as a soldier of
fortune. About 1785 he went to Philadelphia with
a plan for a steamboat. He organized a company,
and secured enough money to enable him to
carry out his plans. His boat was ready by August,
1787, and he made his trial trip in Philadelphia when
the Constitutional Convention was in session. Many
of the members of that distinguished body went down
to the river to see how the new invention worked. It
worked fairly well, but did not arouse much enthusiasm.
Its speed was only three or four miles
an hour and its movement was exceedingly awkward.
It was pushed along by two sets of oars, one set entering
into the water as the other came out. The
steam rowboat of 1787 proved at least to be a failure,
and was abandoned as worthless. Fitch afterward
built another steamboat, but it also met with
accident and came to naught. Heartbroken by his
many failures the poor fellow at last ended his life
with his own hand. He deserved a better fate, for
his experiments taught the world a great deal about
the steamboat.</p>

  1802.
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>While Rumsey and Fitch were making their boats
in America, European inventors were not idle. On
the contrary they were so very active that they almost
won the honor of making the first successful
boat. One of these, William Symington, an Englishman,
built a boat that may, with much justice, be
called the first practical steamboat that was ever
launched. This was the <i>Charlotte Dundas</i> <span class="locked">(Fig.
16)</span> which made its
trial trip on the
Clyde and Firth
Canal in 1802. On
the <i>Charlotte</i> was a
<i>paddle-wheel</i> instead
of Fitch's two
sets of paddles. The
wheel was placed at
the rear of the boat and was drawn by means
of a crank which was turned by a rod attached
to the piston-rod. Watt and his co-workers, a few
years before, had shown how the steam-engine could
be made to turn a wheel and Symington in the construction
of his boat put this principle to good use.
The <i>Charlotte</i> did so well that the Duke of Bridgewater
ordered eight more boats like her to be built
for use on the canal. Symington was elated for he
thought he had at last made a successful steamboat,
that is, a steamboat that would give to its owner a
profit; but he was doomed to disappointment for the
owners of the canal refused to allow steamboats to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
employed upon it, and worse than this the duke soon
died and the inventor's financial support was gone.
The <i>Charlotte</i> was taken off the canal and laid in a
creek where she fell to pieces. The really successful
steamboat had not yet been built.</p>

  FIG. 17.&mdash;FULTON'S STEAMBOAT, CLERMONT.
</div>

<p>It was to be built first where it was needed most,
and that was in America. It was built by a man who
kept his eyes on Rumsey and Fitch and Symington,
and made the best of what he saw. As all the world
knows, this was Robert Fulton. In August of 1807
Fulton's steamboat
the <i>Clermont</i>
<span class="locked">(Fig.
17)</span> made a
trip on the
Hudson River
from New
York to Albany,
a distance of 150 miles, in thirty-two hours, and
returned in thirty hours. Fulton advertised for passengers,
and his boat was soon crowded. "The
<i>Clermont</i>," says an English writer, "was the steamboat
that commenced and continued to run for practical
purposes, and for the remuneration of her owners."
Here was the boat that was wanted&mdash;one
that was financially profitable.</p>

  <img src="images/i_184.jpg" width="338" height="171" alt="" /><br />
  FIG. 18.&mdash;THE BOAT OF STEVENS.
</div>

<p>The paddle-wheels of the <i>Clermont</i> were on the
sides of the boat about midship. As the wheel
turned, about half of it was in the water and about
half was out. There were engineers, even in Fulton's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
day who did not believe the wheels ought to
be on the sides of the boat. Look at waterfowl,
they said, look at the graceful swan; its feet do not
work at its sides, half under the water and half out.
Every animal that swims propels itself from behind,
and its propellers are entirely under the water. So,
thought these engineers, the paddle-wheel of a boat
should be placed behind, and should be entirely covered
by the water. John Stevens, an engineer of
Hoboken, New Jersey, in 1805 built a steamboat according
to this notion <span class="locked">(Fig. 18).</span> A close inspection
of the wheel of the boat would show that it is spiral- or
screw-like in shape. Stevens' boat made a trial
trip on the Hudson and worked well; but after Fulton's
great success the little steamer with its spiral-shaped
wheel in the rear was soon forgotten. The
idea of a screw-propeller, however, was not lost.
It was taken up by John Ericsson, a Swedish engineer,
who, in 1839, built, in an English shipyard
for an American captain, the first screw-propeller
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>that crossed the Atlantic&mdash;the <i>Robert
F. Stockton</i>. This was the last step in the development
of the boat. Since 1839 there has been
marvelous progress in ship-building, but the progress
has consisted in improving upon the invention of Ericsson
rather than in making new discoveries. With
the screw-propeller in its present form we may close
our story of the boat. The homely log propelled by
rude paddles has become the magnificent floating palace.</p>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">"T</span>ic-tac! tic-tac! go the wheels of time. We
cannot stop them; they will not stop themselves."
Time passing is life passing and the measurement
of time is the measurement of life itself.
How important then that our chronometers, or time
measures, be accurate and faithful! It is said that a
slight error in a general's watch caused the overthrow
of Napoleon at Waterloo and thus changed the
history of the world. Because of its great importance
the measurement of time has always been a
subject of deep human interest and the story of the
clock begins with the history of primeval man.</p>

<p>The larger periods of time are measured by the
motion of the heavenly bodies. The year and the
four seasons are marked off by the motion of the
earth in its long journey around the sun; the months
and the weeks are told by the changing moon; sunrise
and sunset announce the coming and the going of day.
The year and the seasons and the day were measured
for primeval man by the great clock in the heavens,
but how were smaller periods of time to be measured?
How was the passing of fractional parts of a day, an
hour or a minute or a second to be noted? An egg
was to be boiled; how could the cook tell when it had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
been in the water long enough? A man out hunting
wished to get back to his family before dark: how
was he to tell when it was time to start homeward?</p>

  FIG. 2.&mdash;A MODERN SUN-DIAL.
</div>

<p>Plainly, the measurement of small portions of
time was a very practical problem from the beginning.
The first attempt to solve the problem
consisted in observing shadows cast by the sun. The
changing shadow of the human form was doubtless
the first clock. As the shadow grew shorter the observer
knew that noon was approaching; when he
could reach out one foot
and step on the shadow of
his head he knew it was
time for dinner; when his
shadow began to lengthen
he knew that evening was
coming on. Observations
of this kind led to the
<i>shadow clock</i> or <i>sun-dial</i>
<span class="locked">(Fig. 1).</span> You can make
one for yourself. On a perfectly
level surface exposed
all day to the sun, place in
an upright position <span class="locked">(Fig.
1)</span> a stick about three feet long, and trace on
the surface the shadows as they appear at different
times of the day. A little study will enable you to
use the shadows for telling the time. Sun-dials have
been used from the beginning of time and they have
not yet passed out of use. They may still be seen in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
a few public places <span class="locked">(Fig. 2),</span> but they are retained
rather as curiosities than as real timekeepers. For
the sun-dial is not a good timekeeper for three reasons:
(1) it will not tell the time at night; (2) it
fails in the daytime when the sun is not shining; (3)
it can never be used inside of a house.</p>

<p>The sun-dial can hardly be called an invention;
it is rather an observation. There were, however,
inventions for measuring
time in the earliest
period of man's history.
Among the oldest of
these was the fire-clock,
which measured time by
the burning away of a
stick or a candle. The
Pacific islanders still use
a clock of this kind.
"On the midrib of the
long palm-leaf they skewer a number of the oily
nuts of the candle-nut-tree and light the upper one."
As the nuts burn off, one after another, they mark
the passage of equal portions of time. Here is a
clock that can be used at night as well as in the daytime,
in the house as well as out of doors. Mr.
Walter Hough tells us that Chinese messengers who
have but a short period to sleep place a lighted
piece of joss-stick between their toes when they go to
bed. The burning stick serves both as a timepiece
and as an alarm-clock.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Fire-clocks of one kind or another have been used
among primitive people in nearly all parts of the
globe, and their use has continued far into civilized
times. Alfred the Great (900 <span class="smallish smcap locked">A.&nbsp;D.</span>) is said to have
measured time in the following way: "He procured
as much wax as weighed seventy-two pennyweights,
which he commanded to be made into six
candles, each twelve inches in length with the divisions
of inches distinctly marked upon it. These
being lighted one after another, regularly burnt four
hours each, at the rate of an inch for every twenty
minutes. Thus the six candles lasted twenty-four
<span class="locked">hours."<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">19</a></span></p>

<p>We all remember Irving's account of time-measurement
in early New York: "The first settlers did not
regulate their time by hours, but pipes, in the same
manner as they measure distance in Holland at this
very time; an admirably exact measurement, as the
pipe in the mouth of a true-born Dutchman is never
liable to those accidents and irregularities that are
continually putting our clocks out of order." This,
of course, is not serious, yet it is an account of a kind
of fire-clock that has been widely used. Even to-day
the Koreans reckon time by the number of pipes
smoked.</p>

  WATER-CLOCK.
</div>

<p>If we could step on board a Malay proa we should
see floating in a bucket of water a cocoanut shell
having a small perforation through which the water
by slow degrees finds its way into the interior. This
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>orifice is so perforated that the shell will fill and sink
in an hour, when the man on watch calls the time and
sets it to float again. This sinking cocoanut shell,
the first form of the water-clock, is the clock from
which has been developed the timepiece of to-day.
With it, therefore, the story of the clock really begins.
In Northern India the cocoanut shell is replaced
by a copper bowl
<span class="locked">(Fig. 3).</span> At the moment
the sinking occurs
the attendant announces
the hour by striking
upon the bowl.</p>

  FIG. 4.&mdash;CHINESE WATER-CLOCK AT
  CANTON.
</div>

<p>The second step in
the development of the
water-clock was made
in China several thousand
years ago. In the
earlier Chinese clock
the water, instead of finding its way into the vessel
from the outside, was placed inside and allowed
to trickle out through a hole in the bottom and
fall into a vessel below. In the lower vessel was
a float which rose with the water. To the
float was attached an indicator which pointed
out the hours as the water rose. By this arrangement,
when the upper vessel was full, the
water, by reason of greater pressure, ran out faster
at first than at any other time. The indicator, therefore,
at first rose faster than it ought, and after a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
while did not rise as fast as it ought to. After
centuries of experience with the two-vessel arrangement,
a third vessel was brought upon the scene.
This was placed above the upper vessel, which now
became the middle vessel. As fast as water flowed
from the middle
vessel it was replaced
by a stream flowing
from the one
above it. The depth
of the water in the
middle vessel did
not change, and the
water flowed into
the lowest vessel at
a uniform rate.
Finally a fourth vessel
was brought into
use. The Chinese
water-clock shown
in <span class="locked">(Fig. 4)</span> has been
running in the city
of Canton for nearly
six hundred years.
Every afternoon at five, since 1321, the lowest jar
has been emptied into the uppermost one and the
clock thus wound up for another day.</p>

<p>To follow the further development of the water-clock
we must pass from China to Greece. In their
early history the Greeks had nothing better than the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
sun-dial with which to measure time. About the
middle of the fifth century <span class="smallish smcap locked">B.&nbsp;C.</span> there arose at Athens
a need for a better timepiece. In
the public assembly the orators were
consuming too much time, and in
the courts of law the speeches of
the lawyers were too long. It was
a common thing for a lawyer to
harangue his audience for seven or
eight hours. To save the city from being talked to
death a time-check of some kind became necessary.
The sun-dial would not answer, for the sun did not
always shine, even in sunny Greece; so the idea of
the water-clock was borrowed. A certain amount
of water was placed in an amphora (urn), in the
bottom of which was a small hole through which the
water might slowly flow <span class="locked">(Fig. 5).</span> When the amphora
was empty the speaker had to stop talking.
The Greeks called the water-clock a <i>clepsydra</i>, which
means "the water steals away." The orator whose
time was limited by a certain amount of water would
keep his eye on the clepsydra, just as a speaker in our
time keeps his eye on the clock, and if he were interrupted
he would shout to the attendant, "You there,
stop the water," or would say to the one who interrupted
him, "Remember, sir, you are in my water."
The story goes that upon one occasion the speaker
stopped every now and then to take a drink; the
orator's speech, it seems, was as dry as his throat, and
a bystander cried out: "Drink out of the clepsydra,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
and then you will give pleasure both to yourself and
to your audience."</p>

  FIG. 6.&mdash;AN IMPROVED
  GREEK CLEPSYDRA.
</div>

<p>At first the Greeks used a simple form of the
clepsydra, but they gradually adopted the improvements
made by the Chinese, and finally added others.
The great Plato is said to have turned his attention
to commonplace things long enough to invent a clepsydra
that would announce the hour by playing
the flute. However this may have
been, there was in use in the
Greek world, about 300 <span class="smallish smcap locked">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, a
clepsydra something like the one
shown in <span class="locked">Fig. 6.</span> This begins to
look something like a clock. As
the water drops into the cylinder
<i>E</i> the float <i>F</i> rises and turns <i>G</i>,
which carries the hour hand
around. Inside of the funnel <i>A</i>
is a cone <i>B</i> which can be raised
or lowered by the bar <i>D</i>. In this
way the dropping of the water is regulated.
Water runs to the funnel through <i>H</i>, and when
the funnel is full the superfluous water runs off
through the pipe <i>I</i>, and thus the depth of the
water in the funnel remains the same and the
pressure does not change. Notice that when the
hand in this old clock has indicated twelve hours
it begins to count over again, just as it does on our
clocks to-day. How easily it would have been to
have continued the numbers on to twenty-four, as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
they do in Italy, and on the railroads in parts of
Canada, to-day.</p>

<p>If we pass from Greece to Rome, our usual route
when we are tracing a feature of our civilization, we
find that the Romans were slow to introduce new
methods of timekeeping. The first public sun-dial
in Rome was constructed about 200 <span class="smallish smcap locked">B.&nbsp;C.</span>, an event
which the poet Plautus bewailed:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry">
Confound the man who first found out<br />
How to distinguish hours! Confound them, too<br />
Who in this place set up a sun-dial<br />
To cut and hack my days so wretchedly<br />
Into small portions! When I was a boy<br />
My stomach was my sun-dial, one more sure,<br />
Truer, and more exact than any of them,<br />
This dial told me when 'twas the proper time<br />
To go to dinner.<br />
</div></div>

  FIG. 7.&mdash;A MEDIEVAL
  CLEPSYDRA.
</div>

<p>The water-clock was brought into Rome a little
later than the sun-dial, and was used as a time-check
upon speakers in the law courts, just as it had been
in Athens. When the Romans first began to use
the clepsydra it was already a very good clock.
Whether it received any great improvements at their
hands is not certain. Improvements must have been
made somewhere, for early in the Middle Ages we
find clepsydras in forms more highly developed than
they were in ancient times. In the ninth century the
Emperor Charlemagne received as gift from the
King of Persia a most interesting timepiece which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
was worked by water. "The dial was composed of
twelve small doors which represented the divisions
of the hours; each door opened at the hour it was
intended to represent, and out of it came the same
number of little balls, which fell, one by one at equal
distances of time, on a brass drum. It might be
told by the eye what hour it was by the number of
doors that were open; and by the
ear by the number of balls that fell.
When it was twelve o'clock, twelve
horsemen in miniature issued forth
at the same time, and, marching
round the dial, shut all the doors."
Less wonderful than the clock of the
emperor, but more useful as an object
of study, is the medieval clepsydra
shown in <span class="locked">Figure 7.</span> This looks
more than ever like the clock we are
accustomed to see. It has weights
as well as wheels. As the float <i>A</i>
rises with the water it allows the
weight <i>C</i> to descend and turns the
spindle <i>B</i> on the end of which
is the hand which marks the hours. Notice carefully
that this is partly a water-clock and partly a
<i>weight</i>-clock. The weight in its descent turns the
spindle; the water regulates the rate at which the
weight may descend.</p>

  FIG. 10.&mdash;A WATCH
  OF THE 16TH
  CENTURY.
</div>

<p>The water-clock just described led easily and directly
to the weight-clock. Clockmakers in the Middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
Ages for centuries tried with more or less
success to make clocks that would run by means of
weights. In 1370, Henry De Vick, a German,
succeeded in solving the
problem. De Vick was
brought to Paris to make
a clock for the tower of
the king's palace, and he
made one that has become
famous. In a somewhat
improved form it
can still be seen in Paris
in the Palais de Justice.
Let us remove the face of
this celebrated timepiece
and take a look at its
works <span class="locked">(Fig. 8).</span> It had
a striking part, and a
timekeeping part, each
distinct from the other.
The figure shows only the
timekeeping part. The
weight (A), of 500
pounds, is wound up by a
crank (the key) at <i>P</i>. <i>O</i> is the hour-hand. If <i>A</i>
is allowed to descend, you can easily see how the
whole system of wheels will be moved&mdash;and that
very rapidly. But if something does not prevent, <i>A</i>
will descend faster and faster, the hour-hand will run
faster and faster and the clock will run down at once.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
If the clock is to run at a uniform rate and for any
length of time, the power of the weight must escape
gradually. In the clepsydra <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Incorrect figure reference"><span class="locked">(Fig. 1)</span></ins> the descent of
the weight was controlled by the size of the stream
of flowing water. De Vick invented a substitute for
the stream of flowing water. Fasten your attention
upon the workings of the saw-toothed wheel <i>II</i> and
the upright post <i>K</i>, which moves on the pivots <i>l</i> and
<i>k</i>, and you may learn what he did. Fixed to the
upper part of the post <i>K</i> is a beam or balance <i>LL</i>,
at the ends of which are two small weights <i>m</i> and
<i>m</i>, and projecting from the post in different directions
are two pallets or lips <i>i</i> and <i>h</i>. Now, as the
top of the wheel <i>II</i> turns toward you, one of its
teeth catches the pallet <i>i</i> and turns the post <i>K</i> a part
of the way round <i>toward</i> you. Just as the tooth
<i>escapes</i> from <i>i</i> a tooth at the bottom of <i>II</i> (moving
from you) catches the pallet <i>h</i> and checks the revolving
post and turns it <i>from</i> you. Thus as <i>II</i>
turns, it gives a to-and-fro motion to the post <i>K</i> and,
consequently, a to-and-fro motion to the balance <i>LL</i>.
<i>II</i> is called the <i>escapement</i> because the power of the
descending weight gradually <i>escapes</i> from its teeth.
In the clepsydra the trickling of <i>water</i> regulated the
descent of the weight; in De Vick's clock the trickling
of <i>power</i> or <i>force</i> from the escapement regulated the
descent of the weight. The invention of this escapement
is the greatest event in the history of the clock.
The king was much pleased with De Vick's invention.
He gave the clockmaker three shillings a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
day, and allowed him to sleep in the clock tower; a
scanty reward indeed for one who had done so much
for the world, for De Vick's invention led rapidly
to the excellent timepieces of to-day, to both our
watches and our clocks. After the appearance of
the weight-clock, the water-clock gradually fell into
disuse, and all the ingenuity of the clockmaker was
bestowed upon weights and wheels and escapements
and balances. A century
of experimenting
resulted in a clock without
a weight <span class="locked">(Fig. 9).</span>
In this timekeeper you
recognize the beginnings
of the modern
watch. The uncoiling
of a spring drove the
machinery. Instead of the balancing beam with its
weights as in De Vick's clock, a <i>balance wheel</i> is
used. The escapement is the same as in the first
weight-clock. The busy and delicately-hung little
balance wheel in your watch is a growth from
De Vick's clumsy balance beam. The spring-clock
would run in any position. Because it could be carried
about it led almost at once to the watch. Many
places claim the distinction of having made the first
watch, but it seems that the honor belongs to the
city of Nürenburg. "Nürenburg eggs," as the first
portable clocks were called, were made as early as
1470. The first watches were large, uncouth affairs,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
resembling small table clocks but by the end of the
sixteenth century small watches with works of brass
and cases of gold or silver were
manufactured <span class="locked">(Fig. 10).</span></p>

  FIG. 12.&mdash;THE FIRST PENDULUM
  CLOCK. (1656.)
</div>

<p>The last important step in the
development of the clock was
taken when the <i>pendulum</i> was
brought into use. The history of
the pendulum will always include
a story told by Galileo. This
great astronomer, the story runs,
while worshiping in the cathedral
at Pisa one day, found the service dull, and
began to observe the swinging of the lamps which
were suspended from the ceiling. Using his pulse
as a timekeeper he learned that where the chains were
of the same length the lamp swayed to and fro in
equal length of time, whether
they traveled through a short
space or a long space. This observation
set the philosopher to
experimenting with pendulums
of different lengths. Among
the many things he learned one
of the most important was this:
a pendulum thirty-nine inches in
length will make one vibration in
just one second of time. Now,
if the pendulum could only be
kept swinging and its vibrations<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
counted it would serve as a clock. Galileo, of
course, saw this, and he caused to be made a machine
for keeping the pendulum in motion <span class="locked">(Fig. 11),</span> but
he did not make a clock; he did not connect his
pendulum with the works
of a clock. This, however,
was done about the
middle of the seventeenth
century, although it is
somewhat difficult to tell
who was the first to do it.
The honor is claimed by
an Englishman, a Frenchman,
and a Dutchman.
The truth is, clockmakers
throughout Europe
were trying at the same
time to make the best of
the discoveries of Galileo,
and several of them
about the same time constructed
clocks with pendulums.
The one who
seems to have succeeded
first was Christian Huygens, a Dutch astronomer,
who, in 1656, constructed a clock, the motions of
which were regulated by the swinging of a
pendulum <span class="locked">(Fig. 12).</span> The weight was attached
to a cord passing over a pulley and gave motion to
all the wheels, as in De Vick's clock. Like De<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Vick's clock also Huygens's clock had its escapement
wheel acting upon two pallets. In the Dutchman's
clock, however, the escapement, instead of turning a
balance beam to and fro, acted upon the pendulum,
giving it enough motion to keep it from stopping.</p>

<p>We need not carry our story further than the invention
of Huygens. Timepieces are cheaper and
better made and more accurate than they were two
hundred years ago, but no really important discovery
has been made since the pendulum was introduced.</p>

<h2><a name="THE_BOOK" id="THE_BOOK">THE BOOK</a></h2>

<p class="p0 p2"><span class="dropcap">W</span>hat is a book? It is an invention by
means of which <i>thought</i> is recorded, and
carried about in the world, and handed down from
one age to another. Almost as soon as men began
to think they began to make books and they will
probably continue to make them as long as they continue
to think. The story of the Book, therefore,
takes us back to the very beginning of human existence.</p>

<p>At first thought was recorded and preserved by
<i>tradition</i>. An account of a nation's deeds, its laws,
the precepts of its religion were stamped, printed, on
the memory of persons specially trained to memorize
these things and hand them down by word of mouth
from generation to generation <span class="locked">(Fig. 1).</span> These
persons were usually priests, who underwent long
years of daily and hourly training in memorizing
what was to be handed down. The Sanskrit Vedas,
the sacred scripture of the Hindoos, were for many
centuries transmitted by tradition, and it is said it
took forty years to memorize them. It is a wonder
it did not take longer, for the Vedas make a volume
as large as our Bible. It is believed that primitive
people everywhere first adopted the method of tra<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>dition
to record and preserve the thought which they
did not wish to perish. We may say, then, that the
first book was written on the tablet of the human
memory.</p>

  FIG. 3.&mdash;MESSAGE-STICKS.
</div>

<p>The first step in the growth of the book was taken
when <i>memory aids</i> were invented. Sometimes we
tie a knot in a handkerchief to help us to remember
something. Now, it was just by tying knots that
primitive man first lent assistance to the memory.
The first material book was doubtless a series of
<i>knots</i> well represented by the <i>quipu</i> <span class="locked">(Fig. 2)</span> of the
ancient Peruvians. This curious-looking book was
written (tied) by one known as the officer of the
knots. It contains an account of the strength of the
Peruvian army, although it is confessed that its exact
meaning cannot be made out. It was not intended to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span>
be read by any one who was not a keeper of the knots.
Books made of knots were used by nearly all the
ancient peoples of South America and by some of
those of Asia. Akin to the knotted cord is the
<i>notched stick</i>, which is still used in Australia by the
savages to assist the memory of one who has a message
to carry. <span class="locked">Figure 3</span> shows a variety of such
message-sticks. The lowest one&mdash;a crooked branch
of a tree&mdash;contains an invitation to a dancing party.
The notches are read by the messenger. The
notched stick as an aid to memory is not confined
to savage races. Many a highly civilized baker has
kept his accounts by making notches in sticks and so
has many a modern dairyman, as he has delivered
milk from door to door.</p>

<p>Memory aids were followed by <i>picture-writing</i>.
To express thought by means of pictures is an instinct
shared alike by the lowest savage and the most
enlightened people. All over the earth we find ex<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>amples
of early picture-writing. A beloved chief
had died, a fierce battle had been fought, an exciting
chase had occurred: promptly the event was pictured
on a stone or on the skin of some animal. Pages
might be filled with illustrations of these primitive
picture-books, but we must be
content with a single specimen
<span class="locked">(Fig. 4).</span> This was found
painted on a rock in California:
"<i>We selected this as a
camping place, but we have
found nothing</i>," say the human
figures <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>, <i>h</i>, <i>i</i>. The
upturned palms say plainly,
"nothing, nothing." "<i>One of our comrades</i> (<i>d</i>)
<i>has died of starvation</i>," say the three lank figures
at <i>c</i> pointing to their own lean bodies. "<i>We deeply
mourn his loss</i>," says the sorrow-stricken <i>a</i>. "<i>We
have gone northward</i>," says <i>j</i>, his distinguished arm
extended to the north.</p>

<div class="fc-cap" style="width: 173px;">
<img src="images/i_206.jpg" width="173" height="144" alt="" /><br />
  FIG. 4.&mdash;PICTURE WRITING.
</div>

<p>Practice in picture-making was bound to lead to
shorter methods of expressing ideas. It was soon
found that reduced pictures, or <i>picture-signs</i>, would
suffice to express ideas. Thus, if the idea of sorrow
was to be expressed it was not necessary to draw an
elaborate picture of a sorrowful looking man like <i>a</i>
in <span class="locked">Figure 4;</span> a weeping eye would express the idea
just as well. Instead of numerous figures (<i>e</i>, <i>f</i>, <i>g</i>,
<i>h</i>, <i>i</i>) weeping and saying, "nothing here," a single
pair of empty palms would say the same thing just<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
as clearly. In this way a pair of clasped hands
came to mean "friendship"; two trees meant "a
forest"; a calf running toward water meant "thirst."
These picture-signs, of course, assumed the form in
which they could be most easily and rapidly drawn.
The weeping eye became
<span class="locked"><img src="images/i_207a.jpg" width="42" height="21" class="sym" alt="[symbol: eye]" />;</span>
the pair of extended
palms
<span class="locked"><img src="images/i_207b.jpg" width="39" height="42" class="sym" alt="[symbol: palms]" />;</span>
the forest
<span class="locked"><img src="images/i_207c.jpg" width="32" height="36" class="sym" alt="[symbol: trees]" />;</span>
thirst
<span class="locked"><img src="images/i_207d.jpg" width="46" height="29" class="sym" alt="[symbol: dog walking on water]" />.</span>
A simple picture of this kind became a fixed conventional
sign for certain ideas; it was always drawn
in the same way and it always stood for the same
idea.</p>

<p>Picture-signs (ideographs) followed picture-writing
in almost every country where the people were
progressive. China was writing its books with
picture-signs many thousands of years ago, and it is
writing them in the same clumsy way still. Even in
highly civilized countries picture-signs have not been
entirely abandoned. Examine the advertising page
of a newspaper or observe the business signs on the
street and you will find picture-signs&mdash;pictures that
are always made in the same way and that always
stand for the same thing.</p>

<p>Each of the great nations of antiquity had its own
peculiar system of writing, but the system that should
interest us most is that of ancient Egypt, for it is to
ancient Egypt that you must look for the origin of
the book that is in your hands. The book in Egypt
passed through the stages of tradition, memory aids,
picture-writing and picture-signs (ideographs); then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
it passed into the <i>alphabetic</i> stage. Since the alphabet
is certainly the most wonderful and perhaps the
most useful of all inventions, and since it is an Egyptian
invention, it is well worth your while to learn
how the Egyptian picture-signs&mdash;hieroglyphics they
are called&mdash;grew into letters, but if you wish to
understand the change you will have to give the subject
very close attention.</p>

<p>Well, here was the Egyptian system of picture-signs
consisting of several thousand pictures of birds,
beasts, reptiles, insects, trees, flowers, and objects of
almost every description. Now suppose you were
employed in writing <i>English</i> by means of several
thousand picture-signs and in the course of an hour
would have to write the words <i>man</i>age, <i>man</i>sion,
<i>man</i>tle, <i>man</i>date, might it not occur to you that it
would be a good thing if that sound <i>man</i> could be
represented by the picture-sign for man
<span class="locked">(<img src="images/i_208a.jpg" width="29" height="41" class="sym" alt="[symbol: man]" />)?</span>
And if you had to write <i>trea</i>cle, <i>trea</i>son, <i>trea</i>ty,
might you not feel like beginning these words with
a tree
<span class="locked">(<img src="images/i_208b.jpg" width="18" height="38" class="sym" alt="[symbol: tree]" />)?</span>
At some time in the remote past
Egyptian scribes&mdash;priests they usually were&mdash;noticing
that syllables identical in sound were constantly
recurring in the different words, began to
represent these <i>syllable-sounds</i> that occurred most
frequently by <span class="locked"><i>picture-signs</i>.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">20</a></span> The picture-sign substituted
for a syllable-sound was placed in the word
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>not because it stood for an <i>idea</i>, but because it stood
for a <i>sound</i>, just as in the case supposed above you
would use the [symbol: man] or the [symbol: tree] not because it represented
a thought, but because it had a certain sound.
So certain Egyptian picture-signs began to be used
to represent the sound of certain syllables. The
picture-signs thus chosen were called <i>phonograms</i>.</p>

<p>The phonogram led to the alphabet. The scribes
in seeking a way to shorten their work found that
the syllable itself could be broken up into separate
sounds. For example, when they came to the syllable
whose sound is spelled by our three letters
<i>pad</i>, they found that it had three distinct sounds,
namely: (1) one a lip sound which could be represented
by the first sound of the picture-sign
<img src="images/i_209a.jpg" width="36" height="37" class="sym" alt="[symbol: door]" />
(a door); (2) one an open-throat or vowel sound
which could be represented by the first sound of the
picture-sign
<img src="images/i_209b.jpg" width="73" height="61" class="sym" alt="[symbol: eagle]" />
(an eagle); (3) one a dental
sound which could be represented by the first sound
in the picture-sign
<img src="images/i_209c.jpg" width="55" height="23" class="sym" alt="[symbol: hand]" />
(a hand). So the scribes
wrote the syllable (p-a-d) with the three characters
<span class="locked"><img src="images/i_209d.jpg" width="179" height="62" class="sym" alt="[symbols: door, eagle, hand]" />.</span>
And so with all the other
sounds in the Egyptian language; each was represented
by one of the picture-signs already used.
Since there were only about twenty-five distinct ele<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>mentary
sounds in the Egyptian language, twenty-five
picture-signs were sufficient to represent any
sound or any word in the language. These twenty-five
picture-sounds were the letters of the Egyptian
alphabet. Twenty-five characters instead of thousands!
Now the Egyptian youth could learn to
read in three or four years, whereas under the old
system it took fifteen or twenty years, just as it takes
fifteen or twenty years for the Chinese youth to learn
to read well.</p>

<p>Now that its origin has been explained, the story
of the alphabet may be rapidly told. Indeed, its
whole history can be learned from <span class="locked">Figure 5.</span> In
column (a) are the three Egyptian picture-signs referred
to above. Column (b) shows how the rapid
writing of the priests reduced the old hieroglyphics
to script;

became
<span class="locked"><img src="images/i_210f.jpg" width="55" height="24" class="sym" alt="[symbol: squiggle]" />.</span>
The Ph&oelig;nicians, who
were great travelers, visited Egypt at a very early
date and borrowed not only the idea of the alphabet,
but also the forms of the Egyptian letters, as column
<i>c</i> shows. Column <i>d</i> confirms the words of Herodotus,
who tells us that the Greeks borrowed their
alphabet from the Ph&oelig;nicians. Column <i>e</i> shows
that the Greeks handed the alphabet on to the
Romans, who handed it on to us. Thus the three
letters p, a, d come straight from the Egyptians and
were originally a <i>door</i>, an <i>eagle</i>, and a <i>hand</i>, re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>spectively.
As it is with these three letters, so it is
with nearly all the letters of our alphabet. If the
letters on the page before you could be suddenly
changed to their original form, you would behold a
motley collection of birds, serpents, animals, tools,
and articles of household use.</p>

  LETTERS, P, A, AND D.</div>

</div>

<p>We must look to Egypt for the origin of the material
form of our book as well as for the origin
of our alphabetical characters. Before history had
dawned the Egyptians had covered over with their
writing nearly all the available surface on their pyramids
and in their temples. At a time too far back
for a date necessity seems to have compelled them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
to seek a substitute for stone. This they found in
the <i>papyrus</i> plant, which grew in great luxuriance
in the valley of the Nile. They placed side by side
strips of the pith of the papyrus, and across these at
right angles they placed another layer of strips.
The two layers were then glued together and pressed
until a smooth surface was formed. This made one
sheet. To make a book a number of sheets were
fastened together end to end. When in book form<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
the papyrus was wound around a stick and kept in
the form of a roll, a <i>volume</i> <span class="locked">(Fig. 6).</span> The roll
was usually eight or ten inches wide, but its length
might be upward of a hundred feet. This papyrus
roll was the parent of our modern paper book, as
the word papyrus is the original of our word paper.
The pen used in writing upon papyrus was a split
reed (<i>calamus</i>), and the ink a mixture of soot and
gum.</p>

      FIG. 7.&mdash;THE OLDEST BOOK IN THE WORLD. WRITTEN NEARLY 5,000
      YEARS AGO.
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class="ca">The most ancient volume in the world is an Egyptian
papyrus <span class="locked">(Fig. 7)</span> now in the National Library
of France. It was written nearly 5,000 years ago
by an aged sage and contains precepts of right living.
In this oldest of volumes we find this priceless gem:</p>

<p>"If thou art become great, if after being in poverty
thou hast amassed riches and art become the
first in the city, if thou art known for thy wealth and
art become a great lord, let not thy heart become<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
proud, for it is God who is the author of them for
thee."</p>

<p>In Assyria and in other ancient countries of
Central Asia letters were engraved on cylinders
and these were rolled upon slabs of soft clay, making
an impression of the raised letters, just as
we make an impression with the seal of a ring. In
the ruins of the cities of Assyria these old clay
books may be found by the cart-load. The Assyrian
cylinder was really the first printing press. In ancient
Greece and Rome wooden tablets within which
was spread a thin layer of wax were used as a writing
surface in schools and in the business world.
The writing on the wax was done with a sharp-pointed
instrument of bone or iron called the <i>stylus</i>.
But next to papyrus the most important writing material
of antiquity was <i>parchment</i>, or the prepared
skin of young calves and kids. The invention of
parchment is said to have been due to the literary
ambitions of two kings, the king of Persia and the
king of Egypt. The king of Pergamus (250 <span class="smallish smcap">B.C.</span>)
wishing to have the finest and largest library in the
world was consuming enormous quantities of papyrus.
The king of Egypt, who also wished to have
the finest library in the world, in order to cripple
the plans of his literary rival, issued a command forbidding
the exportation of papyrus from Egypt.
The king of Pergamus, being unable to get papyrus
except from Egypt, caused the skins of sheep
to be prepared, and on these skins books for his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
library continued to be written. The prepared
skins received the name of <i>pergamena</i>, because they
were made in Pergamus, and from pergamena we
get the word parchment. This is the story that has
come down to us to explain the origin of parchment,
but it cannot be accepted as wholly true. We know
very well that the Old Testament was written in gold
on a roll of skins long before there was a king of
Pergamus. Indeed, writing was done on skins as
far back as the picture-writing period.</p>

<p>After the invention of the alphabet and of paper
(papyrus) books multiplied as never before. "Of
making many books there is no end," exclaimed
Solomon a thousand years before the Christian
era. Greece in her early day was slow to make
books, but after she learned from the Ph&oelig;nicians
(800 <span class="smallish smcap">B.C.</span>) how to use an alphabet she made up for
lost time. In 600 <span class="smallish smcap">B.C.</span> there was a public library at
Athens, and 200 years later the Greeks had written
more good books than all the other countries in the
world combined.</p>

<p>But the most productive of ancient book-makers
were the Romans. In Rome publishing houses were
flourishing in the time of Cicero (50 <span class="smallish smcap">B.C.</span>). Atticus,
one of Cicero's best friends, was a publisher. Let
us see how a book was made in his establishment.
Of course, there were no type-setters or printing-presses.
Every book was a manuscript; every word
of every copy had to be written with a pen. The
writing was sometimes done by slaves trained to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
write neatly and rapidly. We may imagine 50 or
100 slaves sitting at desks in a room writing to the
dictation of the reader. Now if Atticus had ten
readers each of whom dictated to 100 slaves it took
only two or three days for the publication of 1,000
copies of one of his friend Cicero's books. Of
course every copy would not be perfect. The slave
would sometimes make blunders and write what the
reader did not dictate. But books in our own time
are not free of errors. An English poet recently
wrote:</p>

<div class="center">
"Like dew-drops upon fresh blown roses."
</div>

<p>In print the first letter of the last word in the line
appeared as <i>n</i> instead of <i>r</i>. This mistake disfigured
thousands of copies. In the Roman publishing
house such a blunder marred only one copy.</p>

<p>You can readily see that by methods just described
books could be made in great numbers. And so
they were. Slaves were cheap and numerous and
the cost of publication was small. It is estimated
that a good sized volume in Nero's time (50 <span class="smallish smcap">A.D.</span>)
would sell for a shilling. Books were cheaper in
those days than they had ever been before and almost
as cheap as they are to-day, perhaps. The
Roman world became satiated with reading matter.
The poet Martial exclaimed, "Every one has me
in his pocket, every one has me in his hand." Books
became a drug on the market and could be sold only
to grocers for "wrapping up pastry and spices."</p>

  FIG. 8.&mdash;BOOK-MAKING IN THE MIDDLE AGES.
</div>

<p>But a time was to come when books would not be
so plentiful and cheap. With the overthrow of
Rome (476 <span class="smallish smcap">A.D.</span>) culture received a blow from
which it did not recover for a thousand years. The
barbarian invaders of Southern Europe destroyed all
the books they could find and caused the writers of
books to flee within the walls of the churches.
Throughout the Middle Ages nearly all the writing
in Europe was done in the religious houses of monks
<span class="locked">(Fig. 8),</span> and nearly all the books written were of a
religious nature. The monks worked with the greatest
patience and care upon their manuscripts. They
often wrote on vellum (calf-skin parchment) and
illuminated the page with beautiful colors and
adorned it with artistic figures.</p>

<p>The manuscript volumes of the dark ages were
beautiful and magnificent, but their cost was so great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
that only the most wealthy could buy. A Bible
would sometimes cost thousands of dollars. Along
in the 14th and 15th centuries Europe began to thirst
for knowledge and there arose a demand for cheap
books. How could the demand be met? There
were now no hordes of intelligent slaves who could
be put to work with their pens, and without slave
labor the cost of the written book could not be
greatly reduced. Invention, as always, came to the
rescue and gave the world what it wanted.</p>

<p>In the first place, writing material was made
cheaper by the invention of paper-making. The
wasp in making its nest had given a hint for paper-making,
but man was extremely slow to take the
hint. The Chinese had done something in the way
of making paper from the bark of trees as early as
the first century, but it was not until the middle of
the 13th century that paper began to be manufactured
in Europe from hemp, rags, linen, and cotton.</p>

  THE ALPHABET
  USED
  BY CHILDREN
  WHEN LEARNING
  TO READ.
</div>

<p>In the second place, <i>printing</i> was invented. On
a strip of transparent paper write the word <i>post</i>.
Now turn the strip over from right to left and trace
the letters on the smooth surface of a block of wood.
Remove the paper and you will have
the result shown in <span class="locked">Figure 9.</span> With a
sharp knife cut out the wood from
around the letters. Ink the raised
letters and press upon them a piece of paper. You
have printed the word "post" in precisely the way
the first books were printed. In the 13th century<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
fancy designs were engraved on wood and by the aid
of ink the figures were stamped on silk and linen.
In the 14th century playing cards and books were
printed on engraved blocks in the manner the word
"post" was printed above. <span class="locked">(Fig. 10.)</span> The
block-book was the first step in the art of printing.</p>

<p>The block-book decreased the cost
of a book, for when a page was once
engraved as many impressions could
be taken as were wanted, yet it did
not meet the necessities of the time.
In the middle of the 15th century
the desire for reading began to resemble
a frenzy and the books that
could be got hold of "were as insufficient
to slake the thirsty craving
for religious and material knowledge
as a few rain drops to quench
the burning thirst of the traveler in
the desert who seeks for long, deep-draughts
at copious springs of living
water." To meet the demand of the time book-makers
everywhere were trying to improve on the
block-making process and by the end of the century
the book as we have it to-day was being made
throughout all Europe.</p>

<p>In what did the improvement consist? First let
us call to mind what the book-maker in the early
part of the 15th century had to begin with; he had
paper, he had printing-ink, he had skill in engrav<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>ing
whole pages for block-books, and he had a rude
kind of printing-press. The improvement consisted
in this: Instead of engraving a whole page on a
block, single letters were engraved on little blocks
called types, and when a word or a line or a page
was to be printed these types were set in the position
desired; in other words, the improvement consisted
in the invention of <i>moveable types</i>. The types were
first made of wood and afterward of metal.</p>

<p>The great advantage of the moveable types over
the block-book is easily seen. A block containing,
say, the word "post" is useless except for printing
the word <i>post</i>; but divide it into four blocks, each
containing a letter: now you can print <i>post</i>, <i>spot</i>,
<i>tops</i>, <i>stop</i>, <i>top</i>, <i>sop</i>, <i>sot</i>, <i>pot</i>, <i>so</i>, <i>to</i> and so forth.</p>

<p>The exact date of the invention of moveable types<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
cannot be determined. We can only say that they
were first used between 1450 and 1460. Nor can
we tell who invented them. The Dutch claim that
Lawrence Koster of Harlem (Holland) made some
moveable types as early as 1430, and that John
Faust, an employee, stole them and carried them
to Mayence (Germany), where John Gutenberg
learned the secret of printing with them. The Germans
claim that Gutenberg was the real inventor.
Much can be said in behalf of both claims. What
we really know is that the earliest complete book
printed on moveable types was a Bible which came
from the press of John Gutenberg in 1455.</p>

<p>Since 1450 there has been no discovery that has
changed the character of the printed volume. There
have been wonderful improvements in the processes
of making and setting type, and printing-presses
<span class="locked">(Fig. 11)</span> have become marvels of mechanical skill,
but the book of to-day is essentially like the book of
four hundred years ago. The tablet of the memory,
the knotted cord and notched stick, the uncanny
picture-writing, the clumsy picture-sign, the alphabet,
the manuscript volume, the printed block-book and
the volume before you bring to an end the story of
the book.</p>

savages notched sticks bearing messages were sent

<p>The ancient Egyptians, as we
would expect, were the first to make
use of the letter in the sending of
messages <span class="locked">(Fig. 1).</span> The ancient
Hebrews were also familiar with the
letter as a means of communication.
We read in the book of Chronicles
how the post went with the letters
of the king and his princes throughout all Israel.
The word <i>post</i>, as used here and elsewhere in the
Bible, signifies a runner, that is, one specially
trained to deliver letters or despatches speedily<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
by running. Thus Jeremiah predicted that after
the fall of Babylon "one post shall run to meet
another and one messenger to meet another to show
the King that his city is taken." Although we frequently
read of the post in Biblical times we are nowhere
told that the ordinary people enjoyed the
privileges of the post. In olden times it was only
kings and princes and persons of high degree that
sent and received letters.</p>

  FIG. 2.&mdash;AN EGYPTIAN MAIL CART.
</div>

<p>In nearly all the countries of antiquity there was
an organized postal system which was under the control
of the government
and which carried
only government
messages. In
Egypt there were
postal chariots <span class="locked">(Fig.
2)</span> of wonderful
lightness designed especially for carrying the letters
of the king at the greatest possible speed.
In ancient Judea messengers must have traveled
very fast, for Job, in his old age, says: "Now
my days are swifter than the post, they flee away."
In ancient Persia the postal system awakened
the admiration of Herodotus. "Nothing mortal,"
says this old Greek historian, "travels so fast
as these Persian messengers. The entire plan
is a Persian invention and this is the method
of it. Along the whole line of road there are
men stationed with horses, the number of sta<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>tions
being equal to the number of days which the
journey takes, allowing a man and a horse to each
day, and these men will not be hindered from accomplishing
at their best speed the distance they will
have to go either by snow, or rain, or heat, or by
the darkness of night. The first rider delivers the
message to the second and the second to the third,
and so it is borne from hand to hand along the whole
line."</p>

<p>The postal system which Herodotus found in
Persia was better than the system which existed in
his own country for the reason that the Greeks relied
upon human messengers
rather than upon horses to
carry their messages. Young
Greeks were specially trained
<span class="locked">(Fig. 3)</span> as runners for the
postal service and Greek history
contains accounts of the
marvelous endurance and
swiftness of those employed
to carry messages. After the defeat of the
Persians by the Greeks at Marathon (490 <span class="smallish smcap locked">B.&nbsp;C.</span>) a
runner carried the news southward and did not pause
for rest until he reached Athens when he shouted
the word "Victory!" and expired, being overcome
by fatigue. Another Greek, Phillipides by name,
was despatched from Athens to Sparta to ask the
Spartans for aid in the war which the Athenians were
carrying on against Persia, and the distance between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
the two cities&mdash;about 140 miles&mdash;was accomplished
by the runner in less than two days.</p>

  FIG. 4.&mdash;A LETTER CARRIER OF
  ANCIENT ROME.
</div>

<p>But the best postal system of ancient times was
the one which was organized by the Romans. As
one country after another
was brought under the dominion
of Rome it became
more and more necessary
for the Roman government
to keep in close touch with
all the parts of the vast
empire. Accordingly, by
the time of Augustus (14
<span class="smallish smcap">A.D.</span>), there was established throughout the Roman
world a fully organized and well-equipped system
of posts. Along the magnificent roads which
led out from Rome there were built at regular
distances stations, or post-houses, where horses
and riders were stationed for the purpose of receiving
the messages of the government and hurrying
them along to the place of their destination.
The stations were only five or six miles apart and
each station was provided with a large number of
horses and riders. By the frequent changes of
horses a letter could be hurried along with considerable
speed <span class="locked">(Fig. 4).</span> "By the help of the relays,"
says Gibbon, "it was easy to travel a hundred miles
in a day."</p>

<p>When Rome fell (476 <span class="smallish smcap">A.D.</span>) before the attacks of
barbarous tribes her excellent postal system fell with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span>
her and many centuries passed before messages could
again be regularly and quickly despatched between
widely separated points. Charles the Great, the
emperor of the Franks, established (800 <span class="smallish smcap">A.D.</span>) a
postal system in his empire but the service did not
long survive the great ruler. In the 13th century
the merchants of the Hanse towns of Northern Germany
could communicate with each other somewhat
regularly by letter, but the ordinary people of these
towns did not enjoy the privileges of a postal service.
In the Middle Ages, as in the ancient times, the public
post was established solely for the benefit of the
government. Private messages had to be sent as best
they could be by private messengers and at private
expense. As late as the reign of Henry VIII
(1509-1547) the only regular post route in England
was one which was established for the exclusive use
of the king.</p>

<p>But the time was soon to come when ordinary
citizens as well as officers of state were to share in
the benefits of a postal system. In 1635 Charles I
of England gave orders that a post should run night
and day between Edinburgh and London and that
postmen should take with them all such letters as

connected the two cities. The rate of <span class="locked">postage<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">21</a></span> was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>fixed at two pence for a single letter when the distance
was under sixty miles; four pence when the
distance was between 60 and 140 miles; six pence
for any longer distance in England; and eight pence
from London to any place in Scotland. It was
ordered that only messengers of the king should be
allowed to carry letters for profit unless to places to
which the king's post did not go. Here was the
beginning of the modern postal system and the modern
post-office. Henceforth the post was to carry
not only the king's messages, but the messages of all
people who would pay the required postage.</p>

<p>The example set by England in throwing the post
open to the public was followed by other nations,
and before a hundred years had passed nearly all
the civilized countries of the world were enjoying
the privilege and blessings of a well-organized postal
system. It is true that the post for a long time
moved very slowly&mdash;a hundred miles a day was
regarded as a flying rate&mdash;and postage for a long
time was very high, but the service grew constantly
better and by the close of the nineteenth century
trains were dashing along with the mails at the rate
of a thousand miles a day and postage within a country
had been reduced to two <span class="locked">cents,<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></span> while for a nickel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>a letter could be sent to the most distant parts of the
globe.</p>

<p>Thus far we have traced the history of only one
kind of message, the kind that has the form of a
written document and that is conveyed by a human
carrier over land and water from one place to another.
But there is a kind of message which is not
borne along by human hands and which does not
travel on land or water. This is the <span class="locked"><i>telegraph</i>,<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">23</a></span> the
message which darts through space and is delivered
at a distant point almost at the very instant at which
it is sent.</p>

  FIG. 5.&mdash;TELEGRAPHING BY MEANS OF FIRE, 150 B.&nbsp;C.
</div>

<p>The first telegraph was an aerial message and consisted
of a signal made by a flash of light. From the
earliest times men have used fire signals as a means
of sending messages to distant points. When the
city of Troy in Asia Minor was captured by the
Greeks (about 1100 <span class="smallish smcap">B.C.</span>) torches flashing their
light from one mountain top to another quickly carried
the news to the far-off cities of Greece. The
ancient Greeks gave a great deal of attention to the
art of signaling by fire and they invented several
very ingenious systems of aerial telegraphy. The
most interesting of these systems is one invented and
described by the Greek historian Polybius, who
flourished about 150 <span class="smallish smcap">B.C.</span> When signaling with
fire Polybius arranged for using two groups of
torches with five torches in each group, and for the
purpose of understanding the signals he divided the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>letters of the alphabet into five groups of five letters
<span class="locked">each.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">24</a></span> The torches were raised according to a plan
that made it possible to flash a signal that would indicate
any letter of the alphabet that might be desired.
Thus if the desired letter was the third one
of the first group&mdash;that is, the letter <i>k</i>&mdash;one torch
would show which group was meant and three torches
would show which letter was meant <span class="locked">(Fig. 5).</span> In
theory this system was perfect, for it provided for
sending any kind of message whatever. But in practice
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span>it had little value, for it required so many torches
and signals that an entire night was consumed in
spelling out a few words.</p>

  FIG. 6.&mdash;HOOKE'S AERIAL
  TELEGRAPH,
  1684.
</div>

<p>Although the elaborate system of aerial telegraph
proposed by Polybius was not generally adopted,
nevertheless for centuries, both in ancient times and
during the middle ages, the fire signal was everywhere
used for the quick despatch of important news.
In the seventeenth century inventors began to devise
new systems of aerial telegraphy. In 1663, the
Marquis of Worcester, who was always busy with
some great invention (p. 178), announced to the
world that he had discovered a plan by which one
could talk with another as far as the eye could distinguish
between black and white, and that this conversation
could be carried on by night as well as by
day, even though the night were as dark and as
black as pitch. But the telegraph of the Marquis
was like many of his other inventions&mdash;it was
chiefly on paper. In 1864, Dr. Robert Hooke of
England invented a method by which aerial messages
could be sent a distance of thirty or forty miles.
His plan was to erect on hill tops a series of high
poles connected above by cross-pieces and by means
of pulleys suspend from the cross-pieces the letters
of the alphabet which would spell out the message
<span class="locked">(Fig. 6).</span> In order to read the letters at such great
distances the eye was assisted by the telescope, an
instrument which had recently been invented.</p>

  FIG. 7.&mdash;CHAPPE'S
  AERIAL   TELEGRAPH,
  1793.
</div>

<p>But the greatest improvement in aerial telegraphy
was made during the French Revolution by Claude
Chappe, a Frenchman living in Paris. In 1793,
Chappe erected on the roof of the palace of the
Louvre a post at the top of which was a cross-beam
which moved on a pivot about the center like a scale
beam <span class="locked">(Fig. 7).</span> The cross-beam could be moved
horizontally, vertically or at almost any angle by
means of cords. Chappe invented a number of positions
for these arms and each position stood for a
certain letter of the alphabet. Machines of this
kind were erected on towers at places from nine to
twelve miles apart and soon Chappe was sending
messages from Paris to the city of Lille, 130 miles
away. The messages were sent with great rapidity,
for they passed from one tower to another with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
velocity of light&mdash;about 185,000 miles a second&mdash;and
it was possible for the operator to spell out
about 100 words in an hour. And Chappe's messages
could be sent at any time, day or night, for
the arms of the machine were furnished with Argand
lamps for night work.</p>

<p>Chappe's invention was the greatest which had
thus far been made in the history of the message.
The new system of telegraphy proved to be entirely
successful and practical and it was not long before
machines similar to those invented by Chappe were
in use in England and other countries. In 1828,
an English writer had the following words of praise
for aerial telegraphy: "Telegraphs have now been
brought to so great a degree of perfection that they
carry information so speedily and distinctly and are
so much simplified that they can be constructed and
maintained at little expense. The advantages, too,
which result from their use are almost inconceivable.
Not to speak of the speed with which information is
communicated and orders given in time of war, by
means of these aerial signals the whole kingdom
could be prepared in an instant to oppose an invading
enemy."</p>

<p>But the aerial telegraph was soon to have a most
dangerous rival. This rival was <i>the electric telegraph</i>.
Many years before the invention of Chappe
men had been experimenting with electricity with a
view of sending messages by means of an electric
current. These experiments began in 1728 when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
an Englishman named Gray caused electricity to
produce motion in light bodies located at a distance
of more than 600 feet. In 1748, the great Benjamin
Franklin, who conducted so many wonderful
experiments in electricity, sent an electric current
through a wire which was stretched across the Schuylkill
River and set fire to some alcohol which was at
the opposite end of the wire. We may regard the
flash of alcohol as a telegraph, for it could have been
used as a signal. In 1819, Professor Oersted of
Copenhagen brought a magnetic needle close to a
body through which an electric current was passing
and he observed that the needle had a tendency to
place itself at right angles to the electrified body.
In 1825, William Sturgeon of England coiled a
copper wire around a bar of soft iron and found
that when a current of electricity was sent through
the wire the bar of iron became
a temporary magnet;
that is, the bar of iron attracted
a needle when the
current was passing through
the wire and ceased to attract
it when the current
was broken <span class="locked">(Fig. 8).</span>
These discoveries of Oersted
and Sturgeon led to the invention known
as the <i>electro-magnet</i> and the electro-magnet
led rapidly to the invention of the electric telegraph,
for by means of the electro-magnet a signal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
can be sent to a distance as far as a current
of electricity can be sent along a wire. In
1831, Professor Joseph Henry, one of America's
most distinguished scientists, discovered a method by
which an electric current could be sent along a wire
for a very great distance. The next year Henry
constructed and operated an apparatus which was
essentially an electric telegraph <span class="locked">(Fig. 9).</span> "I arranged,"
he said, "around one of the upper rooms
of the Albany Academy a wire of more than a mile
in length through which I was enabled to make
signals by sounding a bell. The mechanical arrangement
for effecting this object was simply a steel
bar permanently magnetized, supported on a pivot
and placed with its north end between the two arms
of a horse-shoe magnet. When the latter was excited
by the current the end of the bar thus placed
was attracted by one arm of the horse-shoe and re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span>pelled
by the other and was thus caused to move in
a horizontal plane and its further extremity to strike
a bell suitably adjusted." Thus by 1832 the electric
current had been used for sending signals at a
distance and the electric telegraph had been invented.</p>

<p>But the electric telegraph was still only a toy.
How could it be made a practical machine? How
could it be used for sending messages in a satisfactory
manner? Inventors everywhere worked diligently
to discover a satisfactory method of signaling
and many ingenious systems were invented. As
early as 1837 a telegraph line was established between
Paddington, England and Drayton&mdash;a distance
of 13 miles&mdash;and messages were sent over
the wire. But the line failed to give satisfaction
and its use was discontinued. The honor of inventing
the first really practical and useful system of
electrical telegraphy was at last won by an American,
S. F. B. Morse, a painter and professor of literature
in the University of the City of New York. In
1832 Morse began to think about a plan for recording
signals sent by electricity and by 1837 he was
about ready to take out a patent for making signals
"by the mechanical force of electro-magnetic motion."
Morse was a poor man and he lacked the
means of conducting his experiments. He was
fortunate, however, in making the acquaintance and
gaining the confidence of Alfred Vail, a student of
the University. Vail furnished the money for the
experiments and assisted Morse in perfecting his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
system. Indeed some of the most original and valuable
features of Morse's system were invented by
young Vail and not by Morse. In the face of much
discouragement and bad luck Morse and Vail worked
patiently on together and by 1843 their invention
was completed.</p>

  FIG. 10.&mdash;THE KEY USED BY MORSE.
</div>

<p>The main feature of Morse's system was to use
the electric current for sending an alphabetical code
consisting of certain combinations of "dots and
dashes." The "dots" were simply clicking sounds
and the "dashes" were simply intervals between
the clicking sounds. The sounds were made by
closing and breaking the current by means of a key
or button <span class="locked">(Fig. 10).</span> If the sender of the message
pressed upon the key and immediately released it
he made at the other end of the line a sharp click
which was called a "dot," and a single dot according
to the code was the letter E. If the sender of
the message pressed upon the key and held it down
for a moment he made what was called a "dash,"
and a single dash according to the code was the letter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
T. Thus by means of "dots and dashes" any letter
of the alphabet could be speedily sent.</p>

  FIG. 11.&mdash;MORSE'S TELEGRAPHIC INSTRUMENT.
</div>

<p>Morse applied to Congress to aid him in his plans
and in 1843 he secured an appropriation of $30,000
for establishing a telegraph line between Baltimore
and Washington. Morse and Vail now hurried the
great work on and by May, 1844, the wires had
been stretched between the two cities and the instruments
were ready for trial. And such heavy, clumsy
affairs the instruments <span class="locked">(Fig. 11)</span> were! "The receiving
apparatus weighed 185 pounds and it
required the strength of two strong men to handle
it. At the present day an equally effective magnet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
need not weigh more than four ounces and might be
carried in the vest pocket." But, awkward and
clumsy as it was, the new telegraph did its work
well. On May 24, 1844, Morse sent from Washington
the historic message, "What hath God
wrought?" <span class="locked">(Fig. 12)</span> and in the twinkling of an
eye it was received by Vail at Baltimore, forty miles
away.</p>

  TO BALTIMORE, MAY 24, 1844.
</div>

<p>The Morse system proved to be profitable as well
as successful and after 1844 the electric telegraph
was soon in general use in all parts of the world.
In the United States cities were rapidly connected
by wire and by 1860 all the principal places in the
country could communicate with each other by telegraph.
In 1861, a telegraph line extended across
the continent and connected New York and San
Francisco. Five years later, thanks to the perseverance
and energy of Cyrus W. Field, of New
York, the Old World and the New were joined together
by a telegraphic cable passing through the
waters of the Atlantic from a point on the coast of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
Ireland to a point on the coast of Newfoundland.
With the laying of this cable, in 1866, all parts of
the world were brought into telegraphic communication
and it seemed that the last step in the development
of the message had been taken.</p>

<p>But the story of the Message did not end with the
invention of the telegraph and the laying of the
Atlantic cable. Almost as soon as inventors had
learned how to send a current along a wire and make
signals at a distance they began trying experiments
to see if they could not also send sounds, especially
the sound of the human voice, along a wire; as soon
as they had made the <i>telegraph</i> they began to try to
make the <span class="locked"><i>telephone</i>.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">25</a></span> In 1855 Professor Wheatstone
of England invented an instrument by means
of which musical sounds made in one part of a
building were carried noiselessly along a wire
through several intervening halls and reproduced at
the other end of the wire in a distant part of the
building. About the same time a Frenchman named
Bourseul produced a device by which a disk vibrating
under the influence of the human voice would,
by means of an electric current, produce similar
vibrations of a disk located at a distance.</p>

  FIG. 13.&mdash;PROFESSOR ALEXANDER
  GRAHAM BELL SPEAKING
  OVER THE FIRST LONG
  DISTANCE TELEPHONE BETWEEN
  NEW YORK AND
  CHICAGO.
</div>

<p>About 1874 Professor Alexander Graham Bell,
of Boston, seized upon an idea similar to that of
Bourseul's. Bell saw in the vibrating disk a resemblance
to the drum of the human ear. In imagination
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>he beheld "two iron disks, or ear drums, far
apart and connected by an electrified wire, catching
vibrations of sound at one end and reproducing them
at the other." With this conception in mind he
went to work to construct an apparatus that would
actually catch the sounds of the voice and reproduce
them at a distance. Bell, like Morse, was without
means to conduct his experiments, but friends came
to his aid and furnished
him with the necessary
money and by 1876 his
labors had resulted in making
a machine that would
carry the human voice; he
had invented the telephone.
At first the telephone was
only a toy and would operate
at only short distances,
but as improvements were
made the distances grew
greater and greater until at
last one could talk in Boston and be heard in Denver,
or talk in New York and be heard in London.
The telephone grew rapidly into favor as a means of
communication and in a short time it was used more
than the telegraph. It is estimated that in the entire
world about ten billion conversations are held over
the telephone in the course of a single year.</p>

<p>As wonderful as the telephone was it was quickly
followed by an invention even more wonderful. Al<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>most
as soon as men had thoroughly mastered the
art of sending messages by the aid of wires they set
about trying to find a way by which messages could
be sent long distances without any wires at all. In
1889, Heinrich Hertz, a German scientist, showed
that electric waves could be sent out in all directions
just as light waves go out in all directions. He also
showed how these waves might be produced and
how they might be detected
or caught as they passed
through space. In 1896,
William Marconi, an
Italian electrician, making
use of the facts discovered
by Hertz, sent a message a
distance of 300 feet without
the use of wires. This was
the first <i>wireless telegraph</i>.
Marconi continued his experiments,
sending wireless messages between places
further and further apart, and by 1911 he was able to
signal without cables across the Atlantic Ocean.</p>

<p>And now it seems that the wireless telegraph is
to be followed by an invention still more wonderful.
Men are now working upon a <i>wireless telephone</i>.
Already it is possible to talk without the aid of
wires between places so far apart as Newark and
Philadelphia, and many inventors believe that it is
only a matter of time when the wireless telephone
will be used side by side with the wireless telegraph.</p>

fire. The lens focused the sun's rays upon a substance that
would burn easily and set it afire. The burning-glass was not
connected in any way with the development of the match.</p>

furnace for centuries, and of course where it was used it was
still called a forge. Thus we are told that in Maryland in 1761,
there were eight furnaces and ten forges. It is said that as
late as twenty-five years ago in certain parts of the Appalachian
regions the American mountaineer still worked the little primitive
forge to make his iron.</p>

little pigs.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_12_12" id="Footnote_12_12"></a><a href="#FNanchor_12_12" class="fnref">12</a>Daniel Webster was another great statesman who turned
his attention to the making of plows. He planned a plow
(<a href="#fig11"><span class="locked">Fig. 11</span></a>) and had it made in his workshop on his farm at
Marshfield. When the plow was ready for use, Webster himself
was the first man to take hold of the handles and try it.
The plow worked well and the great man is said to have been
as much delighted with his achievement as he was with any of
his triumphs in public life at Washington.</p>

<p>Hyphenation, punctuation, and spelling standardized when a predominant choice was available; otherwise unchanged.</p>

<p>Illustrations have been repositioned closer to the text that refers to them, and in many
cases, their relative sizes have been changed.
On some display devices, clicking a blue-bordered illustration will show a larger, higher-resolution version
in the current window.</p>

<p>On some display devices, page numbers of the original book are shown as
<span style="color: #acacac;">[123]</span> in the right margin.
The ones for some full-page illustrations have been omitted.</p>

<p>Page <a href="#Page_81">81</a>: illustration captioned

applied to these two instances as well.</p>
